1,"Defunding the police is important to me because I have lived in poor communities where I have seen the violence perpetrated by police officers on a daily basis. I have also been in communities where the police were not called and issues were able to be resolved without their involvement and due to not involving the police, less violently. I am also a communist and believe the police exist to protect capital, so less of them benefits my political goals.",3,sages
2,"I am pro choice. A person with a uterus‚Äô body is their own, not the governments. No one should have a say with what I do with my body. Abortion is healthcare and is necessary for emergencies and also just for people who accidentally get pregnant and don‚Äôt want to keep it.",3,sages
4,"Standardized testing is important. It helps provide more data on how well students are learning certain subjects and how well they can apply what they learn to relevant problems or questions. There are many different types of standardized tests and they all have different categories. No one is going to be perfect in every subject, but these tests can help determine a student's eligibility for college admission, as well as see what areas they may fall short in. Standardized tests should not be eradicated.",3,sages
5,"I chose the legalization of abortion. I fully believe it should be legal across the board. It is important for the safety of people with uteruses. People deserve full rights and autonomy to their bodies. There are tons of children in foster care that are not being adopted, there is no reason to add more to that. There are health concerns involved with pregnancy. At the end of the day a person deserves a choice",3,sages
6,"I personally believe that people should be vaccinated. So many people died before they were made that wouldn't have if that technology was available. It's a minor inconvenience to keep yourself, your family, and everyone around you safe.",3,sages
8,"Drugs should be legalized.  Drug prohibition has lead to increasing profits for drugs cartels.  Take that money away from the cartels, and law enforcement. and put it towards drug rehab and mental health counseling.",3,sages
13,Affirmative action should continue because there is still a lack of minority groups in positions of power. Affirmative action ensures that doors are opened for all groups to be successful.,3,sages
15,"Abortion:
Abortion should not be entirely illegal. When the life of the mother is at stake, she has priority over the unborn child. This includes things like ectopic pregnancies, which no one considers a viable pregnancy. However, the number of abortions being done has become alarming. We have proof that research organizations are illegally paying to request certain organs for research and are illegally cooperating with groups like Planned Parenthood to supply these organs from abortions. 

Rather than promoting pregnancy prevention among women, we have opted to provide cheap and convenient access to abortions. Abortion is the one medical procedure that is not required to be reported and does not have to follow basic medical standards such as access for emergency personnel and equipment. Women have died because of this refusal to be accountable for a medical procedure. Also, because pro-abortion groups don't want to admit that abortion can have severe emotional impact on a woman, many refuse to offer post-abortion counseling. 

I am fully in support of free birth control for any woman who requests it. That would help cut down on the need for abortions and the mental, physical, and emotional effects that can follow an abortion.",3,sages
17,"For the time being, I believe affirmative action should stay to at least some extent. There are too many minorities afflicted with generational poverty and a distinct lack of opportunity. The poor and disregarded should be lifted up and encouraged. There are inequities in our society that will have to be addressed through action. Affirmative action is one of these. As our society becomes more fair, we can begin to phase it out.",3,sages
18,"I think affirmative action should not be dissolved because America is not yet in a place where institutions that currently are impacted by affirmative action can guarantee equality. Affirmative action was created as an artificial mechanism to guarantee equality and increased diversity in certain institutions because we as a society are not yet in a position to do so ourselves. This equality and increased diversity must be protected because, as evidenced by backlash against movements like Black Lives Matter and the prominence of racism in the United States, we cannot guarantee this equality and diversity alone.",3,sages
19,I believe the police should be defunded to give other groups and organizations more public funding. Police do not need tanks and military grade weapons to do their jobs and we should focus more on community programs that prevent crime all together rather than funding an organization that reacts to crime after it has already happened.,3,sages
20,"I support defending the police because police are trained to be far too violent. People, especially people of color, who are in distress are often shot or battered by police instead of being helped. Having social workers respond to domestic violence calls or suicidal people would be more effective, and could potentially save taxpayers money. People think that police won't be able to respond when they are needed, but that is incorrect. First of all, basically nobody is calling for police to be completely defended. We just want them to spend less money on literal tanks and more money on helping people. Also, we all saw what happened at the school in Texas. Police, even when funded, often are too cowardly to do anything.",3,sages
24,"I want to write about the standardized tests. I think they should be abolished in favor of something different. It seems to me like the testing companies have states/schools/etc by the cahonies. Myself and my kids were all terrible test takers, yet we all have done fine in life. Just because someone is a good test taker doesnt mean anything, and just because someone is a bad test taker, that doesn't mean anything either.",3,sages
26,"Abortion

I am very pro-choice and DO NOT believe that abortion should be illegal. The decision as to whether to bear a child is one of the most important a womxn will make in their life. Women should not have to explain why they don't want to carry a child and should be given the option of termination regardless of the reason. In extreme cases of rape and incest, carrying a child can be traumatic. The outlawing of abortion will only force women to subject themselves to unsafe means to terminate a pregnancy, increasing the rates of female mortality. Further, an embryo or fetus can not survive on its own when removed from the women's uterus; thus, it should not have the same rights as a full-fledged human being.",3,sages
28,"I strongly support the legalization, regulation, and taxation of psychedelics and barbiturates. The legalization of marijuana in Colorado generated millions in tax dollars, deprived mexican drug cartels of billions of dollars, supported local entrepreneurs, and standardized a safer product.",3,sages
29,I think keeping standardized testing in place is best for poor and low income students who may struggle with grades and being able to be involved in extra curriculum activities and this tests allows Lemon ability to set them selves apart in this context. I think a lot of times people think this will help them I think actually it stripped of their abilities to leap forward,3,sages
32,"Removing standardized testing is something I feel personally about because I struggle with test anxiety and understand how stressful they can be. Some students take this test so seriously and use it to determine how smart they are, how skilled they are, and what they‚Äôre worth. I feel strongly that these tests do more harm than good and should be discontinued.",3,sages
33,"As I stated previously. Abortion should be every woman's personal choice. A choice they have already been making for themselves for decades. Some crusty, old, straight, white man in a position of authority has no right to decide what a woman can or can't do with her body. The minute that right is taken away they will start to think they can (as they have already shown they want to) take away the rights of other groups of people.",3,sages
34,"I think abortion is a way more complicated issue than people outraged about it present. Both the mother and fetus are human life. Both deserve to live. Sometimes that's not possible for health reasons. In the future birth control will be widely available and pretty much fool proof so abortion rates will be null to minimal. We'll look back 100 years from now at pro-choice as barbaric, but we don't live in the future yet, today abortion is still a very necessary evil.",3,sages
35,"I think at the point that vaccines were shown not to prevent transmission, the idea of a vaccine mandate should‚Äôve been eliminated. There‚Äôs no benefit to workplaces, as anyone, vaccinated or not, can spread Covid. Since it doesn‚Äôt prevent getting Covid either, it shouldn‚Äôt be mandated. At this point, the only thing it does is prevent severe Covid, if it even does that. If they want to risk their health, that should be someone‚Äôs choice. No one‚Äôs outlawed cigarettes or fast food, and those kill millions every year.",3,sages
36,"Abortion should NOT be illegal: 

There are many situations in which abortions are the only option for a woman. That choice should not be taken away from a woman as it is her body and her decision. If we as a country advocate for the separation of church and state why does the same argument not apply to this matter? There are so many situations in which women or young girls have been sexually assaulted or raped and now have a child that they are unfit to carry. Should be stuck with a child that is a constant reminder of the trauma that she endured. Just because abortions are illegal does not mean that women will not find other (potentially much more dangerous) ways to stop their pregnancies. We as a country are moving backward rather than progressing forwards.",3,sages
37,"There are no good outcomes to taking drugs recreationally. An addict is still an addict whether the drug they took is legal or not. People say that there would be less crime if drugs were legalized, but someone who is stealing to get money for drugs will still do that if the drugs are sold at CVS. Their lives will still be ruined by addiction if the drugs are legal. They still put themselves and other people in danger with their behavior under the influence. Many of the drugs that are illegal, including ones people consider harmless like marijuana, can cause psychosis. A society full of people getting stoned is never going to be a good society.",3,sages
38,"I hold the stance that illicit drugs should NOT be legalized because I see absolutely no positive outcomes for people who use illicit drugs. They kill people, destroy families, and break hearts.",3,sages
40,"Standardized tests are used in college admissions to gauge where applicants stand in the applicant pool. Students apply from a variety of different schools, and school districts. Research has shown that standardized tests are only able to predict performance of the first year of college at best.  Past grades are better in predicting students' future success in a college setting.",3,sages
41,"Standardized testing offers a clear assessment of a students progress or not.  It also by drilling down shows his/her school success or failure to educate this student.  It also charts our students progress and success against other countries students.  We can see, with accuracy, whether our educational system is properly preparing our students for both academic and real world success in a globalized economy and ever more connected world.  Removing these standards doesn't help current or future students as we don't know how successful they are in school or whether their schools are just passing them along from one grade to another or they really are successful in a challenging academic environment.  Standardized testing should be kept to help measure progress, success, and failures of both students and their schools.",3,sages
43,Defunding the police would be a bad idea because it will lead to a surge in criminal activity which will  make the streets less safe and lead to more deaths from violent crimes like shootings.,3,sages
44,"Abortion should be legal because the majority of Americans want it to be. There should be no question that if the case of health of mother, incest or rape the fetus should not have to be carried to term. I would also add if the baby cannot survive outside of the womb. 
The majority of arguments against it are religions based ethical or moral arguments. Religion has no place in politics.",3,sages
46,"I believe that vaccines should never be mandatory.  The ""science"" behind them in shaky and unreliable.  They have never done a true vaccinated vs unvaccinated study for any of the vaccines.  They hide adverse reactions and blame them on other things.  Most vaccines don't even prevent the disease they are supposed to.",3,sages
47,I believe mandatory vaccines are the safest and most logical way to keep our population safe from disease and to also protect those that immune compromised.,3,sages
48,"I oppose abortion. I think it's philosophically unjustifiable and the arguments, like Judith Thomson's, are unsound. It is not a matter of ""bodily autonomy"", because the child also carries that autonomy. All opposing arguments I've encountered are fallacious.",3,sages
49,"Vaccine mandates.  I'm all for it, and I don't see how any rational, reasonable person wouldn't be.  Why put yourself and your family at risk?  When death is involved, why would you knowingly choose that fate?",3,sages
51,I support the legalization of drugs. I feel that most importantly it is the individuals right to decide what substances they ingest and for  what purposes. I believe that the war on drugs has been largely ineffective much like the prohibition of alcohol.,3,sages
52,"Defund the police is not actually ‚Äúdefunding‚Äù it means to restructure and hold accountable. Police do not prevent crime anyway. They need to be better trained and need to be a diverse group. They need to be held accountable when they commit crimes- they also need to be held accountable financially by paying these huge lawsuits out of their own pension funds, NOT from taxpayer money.",3,sages
54,The legalization of abortion is an issue that I care deeply about. It is not only a medical necessity in our society but it broached on our need for bodily autonomy and what can be at risk without legalization. Making abortion illegal wouldn't stop abortions from happening it would only mean that safe abortion would only be available to people with means and would be unsafe for everyone else.,3,sages
55,I support continuing affirmative action because the work of social justice isn't done. Under-represented populations continue to need prioritizing to try to help make up the ground lost by years of racist systems and attitudes. It's a moral issue.,3,sages
56,Abortion should not be illegal.  Women should be able to choose whether or not they have one.  I had an abortion when I was 22 to a man who was abusive and would have used the child against me.  I do not regret a single thing about it.  I'm so glad I had that choice and it was mine to make.   I support that right for everyone.,3,sages
58,"I believe affirmative action should be removed with student race not being a factor in the admission process, with past academic success and potentially being the primary factor into acceptance/rejection. If universities and politicians want more people of color to be accepted into top universities on merit alone more funding needs to be available to ensure all students regardless of socioeconomic background have an equal chance of succeeding rather than just meeting a quota.",3,sages
60,"For anyone who ever planned on caring enough to reevaluate their positions on this matter, it's not difficult to discover why psychoactive chemicals have ever been banned in the United States. It hasn't usually been about popular consensus. Instead, it's usually ultimately revolved around corporate interest. 

The simple fact is that even upon perusal of most ingenuous anti-legalization literature, studies are referenced which demonstrate the pervasive inaccuracy of most anti-legalization claims: the ""slippery slope"" fallacy, the fear-mongering about stoned drivers wreaking incessant havoc on public roads, and so on. It's all heavily dramatized or just plain wrong.  

Even acknowledging that some civil and criminal issues will pop up as a result of legalization, there is no concrete reason whatsoever for substances like alcohol and tobacco to be legal, while less harmful substances still incur legal wrath.

Drugs other than marijuana, more harmful ones, should still be legalized, although regulated much ore tightly. A portion of people will always be drawn towards hard drugs; them doing so outside the confines of the law destroys society without the framework to repair it that legalization could provide.",3,sages
61,I think mothers should have the ability to choose to get an abortion. This is important because it's her body and she needs to have said choice if it is necessary.,3,sages
62,"Standardized tests should be removed. They have been proven to both be an inaccurate measurement of educational ability and have also been proven to unfairly favor white people. They also provide zero benefit, as they are just an arbitrary measure of intelligence and doesn't actually demonstrate any real-world ability.",3,sages
65,"Illicit drugs should not be legalized at all. While marijuana could enhance public health, people will abuse the  legalization. Crime and violence will increase caused by drug addicts, and local governments would have to increase spending on law enforcement to control it. It also makes it way easier for adolescents to get access to these drugs. Most illicit drugs, such as cocaine and opioids don‚Äôt even have any health benefits anyway, and will only do harm.",3,sages
66,"I think vaccine mandates are important. They are preventative, ideally, and not reactive to a problem. Many are concerned with side effects and fundamental attacks on their bodily autonomy, but the greater good outweighs these concerns, and legal recourse does exist if the entity mandating the vaccine fails to ensure its safety. There are generally too many people in the modern world, who all live too closely to one another in urban centers, literally akin to animals. Vaccines prevent disaster in such communities and mitigate risk of unnecessary death. They also ensure the safety of children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised who are not always able to protect themselves. To defy that point, at the very least, is immoral, and those who disagree share the culpability of murderers.",3,sages
67,"I believe that ""defunding the police"" doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of law enforcement but rather redistributing money and resources and making room for additional social services to respond to 9-11 calls that don't need police intervention. This will free officers up to respond to the more dangerous scenes where suspects may be armed or an ongoing crime is happening. Moreover, when somebody is having a mental health crisis or there's another situation which needs a calm, de-escalating response, people trained to handle those types of situations--without weapons blazing--can respond to those.",3,sages
68,"Vaccines are an important requirement. They not only protect you, but also others.",3,sages
69,The legality of abortion. I feel abortions should be legal. The government has no right to govern a women's body. Men are not held to the same standard and women do not create children on their own. A women should have the right to choose what to do with her own body.,3,sages
70,"We shouldn't defund the police because a lot of black people are getting killed by police. While racism exists, the issue is more about class. Poor people are killed by police, not just blacks. Many blacks happen to be poor, so we confuse the issue. The police do a lot of important work. We should spend more money giving them better training. We can save money by giving them fewer weapons.",3,sages
71,"When it comes to the issue of defunding the police I am slightly leaning towards that ideal. The social issues that are brought are due to the police not acting the way they should be. More violence has been created because of police not listening and not doing their job correctly. Last of all, this isn't just due to social issues, recently with the Robb Elementary school shooting the lack of police effort was a huge deal that caused an issue worldwide about realizing that the police aren't taking measures to protect communities like they are supposed to and rather harming them more.",3,sages
74,"Drug legalization would put less people in prison, create a large surplus for taxes in many states that would likely put up government owned drug dispenseries. This could be used for the greater good, better roads, schools, healthcare, among other things. More freedom for people, is generally good, some drawbacks could occur with more addiction and dependencies on the population, but at the same time some drugs that are illegal now across the country are showing in studies to be effective at treating certain mental illnesses and other physical illnesses.",3,sages
75,Abortions should be legal to anyone because it is a women‚Äôs choice what to do with her body and the government should not be able to tell someone what they have to do with their own body.,3,sages
76,"I believe that standardized tests should not be a part of academic admissions criteria because the practice prevents many bright, hardworking students from participating in these programs. We have learned that tests are not the gold standard for evaluating a person's intelligence, as psychological, social, cultural, and economic factors all have an impact on test-taking abilities, particularly when the tests are designed with a particular bias towards a certain population. If we want to grow as a nation, we need an educated workforce, and that means opening up educational programs to learners of all types.",3,sages
79,"I am pro-choice when it comes to abortion. Right now I do not believe I would ever have one, however, I have never been put into the position where I had to think about abortion as an option. I do believe it should be an option available to anyone in an adverse situation, but I do not believe it should be used as a form of birth control. There should be a time limit you should not exceed unless medically necessary for the mother or fetus. There should be a limit on how many abortions you are able to obtain in a certain time.",3,sages
81,I believe vaccines should be mandated because they help stop the spread of horrible diseases that can wipe out millions of people.,3,sages
84,"Out of the three, I am most passionate about the defunding of the police. In my community, the police are absolutely useless. They accomplish almost nothing and in fact, make many situations worse. My town just spent millions of dollars opening a brand new compound for the local police because their current station wasn't massive enough - meanwhile, there are little to no mental health resources in the community, and our schools are suffering by being underfunded.",3,sages
85,"I believe that standardized tests are an important part of college admissions. They were originally a way to directly compare students from different high schools. Without a standardized system, students from highly ranked high schools have a big advantage in the admissions process.",3,sages
88,"The SAT/ACT tests being removed from college admissions is something I strongly oppose. Everyone I knew studied extremely hard for this tests and the ones that put in the work got the right results. People who claimed to be bad test takers happened to be the people who didn‚Äôt care about them at all. They measure basic knowledge as well as ability to prepare and perform under pressure. It‚Äôs definitely difficult, but helps prepare students for difficulties they‚Äôll face in college.",3,sages
90,"I do not support defunding the police, because I believe that it promotes crime. However, I do support police reform and actually having checks of power on the police especially when it comes to racial bias. This is because I do believe there is a problem with police brutality and racial biases, but I do believe we still need the police.",3,sages
91,"I believe that vaccines should be mandated because they keep our communities safer while particularly protecting the most vulnerable people in a population. It is our duty as a society to do what we can to keep our communities healthy, and mandates ensure this by normalizing this view. The pandemic has shown that a large proportion of Americans will choose to act selfishly given the choice, and personal freedom can only stretch so far when lives are at stake.",3,sages
92,"I am deeply conflicted on the subject of abortion. I look at my children and grandchildren and cannot comprehend anyone killing a helpless infant.

That being said, I am appalled and disgusted by what I view as completely hypocritical and shameless pandering by the GOP to the minority Evangelical ‚Äú Christian ultra right.

I recall that Hitlers Germany was a Christian country.

I strongly object to political hacks forcing laws to pander to a minority",3,sages
95,"Defund the police- I don't support a total defunding of the police, but I feel police departments get an outsized proportion of funding in most municipalities/states. Police have proven themselves to be incapable of deescalating and resolving many issues like domestic disputes, mental health emergencies, minor traffic violations, drug use, etc. Police often create worse outcomes for those situations and then after they kill someone for no reason, the organization will pay millions of dollars in damages to the families/victims. Excess funding should be removed from police departments to come up with better programs/solutions/responses for those types of problems and let police focus on violent crimes, sexual crimes, theft, white collar crime etc. We should also stop funding the damages that come from lawsuits from their mistakes, that should come directly from the officers involved and the department's police pension/retirement fund.",3,sages
97,"Abortion- I have no opinion on this, it isn't for me to debate the issue, I do not vote as I believe one vote does not matter and the opinion of one person matters very very little in a population this size. Thus I don't care about it.",3,sages
98,"I think vaccines should be mandated because people should not be able to walk around freely spreading a preventable disease.  Nobody's personal beliefs are more important than the medical science.  If people choose to not be vaccinated they shouldn't be allowed in schools, offices, stores, etc...",3,sages
99,"Making abortion illegal.  I have strong stances on this topic as I believe in a woman's right to choose.  There are many circumstances that need to be considered when a woman is making the choice to maintain a pregnancy that are not always black and white.  Many circumstances can lead to a dangerous position for the woman and even death.  Not only extreme circumstances such as death are to be considered but also socio economics.  If a woman is living in poverty, she will continue to live that way if she is forced to raise a child.  Then, that child will be raised in poverty and a cycle will continue.",3,sages
101,"Why should abortion be legal? Women should be in control of their own bodies. A fetus is not a living person and the actual mother's life should be considered of more value. Abortion can be beneficial as a life-saving procedure. Very few women are choosing third trimester abortions except in life-saving circumstances, and so the issue applies only when the fetus is much smaller. Women should also have confidentiality about these medical procedures, which goes away if abortion is outlawed. We are effectively denying women their liberty by restricting access. And, many will still get them anyway, but via much less safe procedures.",3,sages
102,"Defunding the police is a catchall for the worries people have about police abusing their power. Also, the funding they receive has mostly been spent on militarization of the police force rather than focusing on community involvement and more caring approaches to law enforcement. Police are often, rightfully, seen as bullies and the massive funding the departments receive is a major reason behind this. I think that it is important for police departments to work with the community rather than fighting it and while I think that funding levels should not actually be cut but repurposed to better serve the communities, however unless that change is mandated it is unlikely to happen, so I support short term defunding to get police departments more in line with what their goals should be.",3,sages
106,"For vaccine mandate, I support the vaccine mandate because it reduces hospitalization and disease severity which helps to end the pandemic.",3,sages
108,"I think abortion should be legal. I hold this position because bringing a new human into the world is life-altering for everyone involved, and no abortion access causes more harm than it solves. Every child deserves to be born to a loving and safe environment. Every person with a uterus deserves to decide if they will continue a pregnancy or not. Pregnancy also carries a lot of medical risk, and abortion is a lower risk than pregnancy.",3,sages
109,"For whether standardized tests should be used in college admissions, I am unsure where my position lies because it is a complicated issue and I can see both sides of the problem. On the one hand, studies have shown that standardized tests may discriminate against students who are less well-off because they don't have the resources needed to succeed as well, and the tests are not an accurate reflection of the totality of student ability, but on the other hand, some sort of metric is needed to understand an applicant's ability in certain academic subjects, at least for some programs, and having more information about a student's strengths and weaknesses can be helpful.",3,sages
110,"When it comes to SAT's being removed, I think that they should. The reason I think that is because there is many other ways to test a student's ability and efficiency on how well they perform and they could be good in many other areas and just an overall bad tester due to anxiousness, overthinking or any other reason. This shouldn't be the make or break for a student in the future, Especially when it gets up to the college level.",3,sages
112,"I believe that drugs should be legalized. Far too many people are incarcerated for drug use and related crimes. Legalizing drug use would allow law enforcement to focus on more important matters, allow prison overcrowding to be alleviated, and allow for additional tax revenue to flow into government coffers. It would also allow people to decide for themselves what they put into their bodies. Alcohol, cigarettes, and bad food are not outlawed for adults, so why should drugs they are willingly choosing to take? Time to let people make their own decisions.",3,sages
114,"Affirmative Action.
as a visible POC myself I really do not like Affirmative Action. it is unfair to hold people accountable today for what MAY have happened to someone who looks like you decades or centuries ago. we should strive to judge people based on what that specific person does. I do not want people thinking that I have my job because of Affirmative Action or that my kids got into college not because they were qualified but because of the color of their skin. anyone who talks about ""equality"" and is for this racist program is a hypocrite and a liar. I want people to be judged the way MLK did - on the content of their character and not on the color of their skin. it is especially strange because a person who just came to this country can be considered ""oppressed"" and a ""victim"" so they get special rights that a poor person living here their whole life never sees.",3,sages
122,"I strongly support defunding the police, which is divisive in part because of the connotations that phrase implies. I don't think police should be abolished, or that they shouldn't be armed. What I do support is using part of their budget to hire qualified mental health professionals that can handle non-violent emergencies. It would reduce strain on the police department, who can better focus on violent crime, and help prevent needless escalation of situations that, more often than not, can be resolved peacefully by a social worker. These programs already exist all over the country, and the vast majority require zero police backup and save the police department thousands of dollars.",3,sages
123,"I‚Äôm a big advocate for the issue of abortion as I believe that there are many mothers who are victims of rape and could potentially be killed from having a baby, so it should be readily available. Additionally, children should only be brought to this world if they will be loved, which isn‚Äôt often the case as women who can no longer abort may be incapable mothers.",3,sages
125,"Drug legalization
I believe drugs should be legalized. The War on Drugs was lost decades ago.  The drug market is now controlled by criminals.  If legalized, less adulterated drugs would probablly be available. We could free up resources to treat mental health.  Drug laws have been disportionately enforced upon minorities",3,sages
126,"I believe drugs shouldn't be legalized. In fact, I'm of the controversial opinion that we should further restrict currently legal drugs (marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco -- I say make the legal age 26, after your brain has fully developed). 

I have a lot of medical personal in my family, so I often get told of the latest studies of the effects of drugs. And not just 1st hand but 2nd and 3rd hand as well in the case of smoking. These things, when not administered by a doctor to treat a specific condition, are very hazardous and impactful. Therefore I say that people shouldn't be using them to self-medicate and especially not for a pleasurable high. 

Now I also understand that legalizing them would allow people to be more safe when using them. That is an important argument, I lost a cousin due to a drug he illegally bought containing fentanyl instead of what he thought it was. But I still think we shouldn't be encouraging non-prescribed drug use. In my cousin's case, he couldn't afford prescribed pain medication for a back issue, so I think we should instead start lowering medical costs by restructuring the insurance industry.",3,sages
127,"Abortion should not be illegal. It should not be a crime. In this modern day, women and people able to have children, shouldn‚Äôt have restrictions put on their bodies. There are so many different scenarios I can think of in which it should not be illegal. There are way too many people out there who are not yet financially responsible or capable of raising a child. Let‚Äôs not forget the ones who had a child forced upon them. It isn‚Äôt fair. Everyone should have rights over their own bodies. It‚Äôs 2022 and it feels like they are trying to go back in time. It‚Äôs not right.",3,sages
128,"Abortion is a very hot topic currently, and it has meaning to me for multiple reasons. Firstly, I'm not a fan of government control; I believe certain things need to be controlled, but this isn't one of those things. Secondly, Mother mortality rate during illegal abortions is horrific and the law doesn't stop them from happening. Thirdly, I don't believe all fetuses have the right to live if they greatly impede the mother (I won't be elaborating at this time, but this is a huge gray area that shouldn't be black and white.) Lastly, I'm in support of abortion if it's to prevent absolute suffering of the fetus.",3,sages
131,"I feel it's important for the police to be well funded. Otherwise, they will have insufficient resources to protect people with. Additionally, the police force may be less motivated to risk their lives for less pay. If the police get defunded, the local government will be to blame if lives are lost because of it.",3,sages
132,"Because multiple-part abortion is legal only in certain circumstances, most states allow it if the pregnancy is the result of rape, if it puts the woman's life at risk, and when the abortion is accidentally induced, 2 In the public discussion, the points of view indicated usually conflict and this is evident in the situations where the subject acquires preponderance in the media.",3,sages
133,"Abortion should be reserved only if the mother's life is in danger.  Aborting fetuses is basically murder since the age of viability is irrelevant and just a flimsy excuse to go ahead and end an otherwise healthy pregnancy.  It should not be allowed even if women say they have rights to their bodies since the fetus is ""another? life to consider in the choice of the mother.",3,sages
138,"Police should be defended because they have been given far too much money in order to become more militarized. Police should be funded enough to protect and serve but not like a military. Additionally, money could be used to fun community outreach and mental health services to respond to appropriate situations that don't require an armed police presence. Police officers also tend to be under-educated compared to the level of decision-making that goes into their profession. Teachers require more education and they aren't usually responsible for life and death decisions.",3,sages

It's your choice and shouldn't be forced upon someone.",3,sages
140,i think defunding the police is something that should be considered. the money can be reinvested in the community and help those who need it so they don‚Äôt end up needing the police. there can be a creation of a newer law enforcement because the current one is structured within a corrupt and racist institution. the current system gives regular people power over others in an unsafe and gross way that cannot be taught away.,3,sages

151,"Defunding the police is a very difficult and complicated policy. On one hand, we have to demilitarize our police forces. They are not the military and fighting wars, yet they are outfitted with weapons of war, but not properly trained to handle much of what happens in the streets with emotionally disturbed people, domestic disputes and low level crimes such as drug possession, homelessness and shop lifting. They must absolutely be retrained and re-educated to handle the majority of their daily duties. More outreach to social workers and child services instead of armed conflicts. At the same time, we cannot allow armed criminals to take advantage of changed policy, so a hardcore element of crime fighting is still required.",3,sages
152,"I suppose the biggest issue is on abortion.  I don't feel like the Supreme Court should so easily have turned again Roe v Wade and took away the constitutional right of women to have an abortion.  I am not a woman, but if I were a woman, I would feel like my country has turned against me.  I don't see why the Religious Right has such a strong hold in the Republican party.  Also, I think it is such a misjustice that a woman would lose her life because of health concerns that could be alleviated if she were to have an abortion.  I think it's horrible that Texas allows people to sue one another over abortion when it has nothing to do with that person.  I do think that abortion should be controlled on some level, but definitely it shouldn't be taken away and laws put into place that don't take into account a woman's life situation.",3,sages
155,"I feel that abortion should be legal up until certain period. Woman or people with uteruses who have the ability to get pregnant should be in control of their body and to force these people to go through something that is life changing and can uproot everything is irresponsible and not humane. Our country doesn't even provide a great life for people who need help when they get pregnant and need to raise their children. It would be one thing if this country provided the basic for children and babies to flourish but this country doesn't provide that and sometimes, feels like they purpose are ruining children's lives. Additionally even if the government provided support, they should not be telling people what to do with their bodies. Some of these people might not have wanted the pregnancy whether it was due to accidental pregnancy, getting raped or have health complications that may affect the pregnant person or the baby in utero and to force them to go through pregnancy and birth is so irresponsible and evil. The government doesn't govern men's bodies and only wants to control women to keep them down.",3,sages

It isn't fair to the mother, it isn't fair to the child, and it's not fair to the father either. Children should not be used as tools of punishment for a woman having sex, and women should be allowed full bodily autonomy like men do. We cannot force dead people to donate organs to save the lives of others. Women should not be forced to allow a fetus to occupy their body.",3,sages

162,"I believe that standardized testing should not be mandatory. I think that state standardized tests should not be hung over teacher's heads as a looming threat. There should be another way that states confirm that teachers are doing their jobs well, such as each student reporting on one thing they learned a lot about in each subject every year, or teachers providing evidence of their student's progression through the year. I think that federal standardized tests like the SAT and ACT should be options for students who want to go to college and prove that they are proficient in test taking, but I do not think they should be required, regardless of whether or not the student has an IEP or 504 Plan. I think these things because tests are not always a good representation of intellect of students, or of the skill of teachers. Some students could know all of the information in the real world, but fail the test, while other students could ace the test because of pure luck.",3,sages

Being forced to give birth to a child with birth defects only for them to die a painful death shortly afterwards would be far more heartbreaking than getting an abortion. I believe many of the negative viewpoints concerning abortion are perpetuated by harmful stereotypes. The majority of abortions are performed due to perfectly valid health or economic reasons. Nobody should be forced to raise a child they are not prepared for.",3,sages

This includes anencephaly, trisomy 13, trisomy 18, etc.  In this case, as opposed to an abortion, I'd prefer the child simply be delivered prior to viability so that they suffer less or not at all.  If it is past viability, allow them to be born and diet in their own time.  The same principles apply when the mother's life is at risk.  Simply deliver the baby when necessary and let the chips fall where they may for the baby.  There are no other cases in which a mother cannot have the baby and then place it for adoption.",3,sages
174,"As a woman, the issue I most identified with was abortion. Having experienced an abortion and afterwards having four beautiful and wanted children I can see both sides of the issue.

On the one side, I, like many other girls/women got pregnant way too young. I was not equipped mentally, emotionally, or financially to have a child at that time so I made a hard choice. Having made that hard choice had both positive and negative consequences. 

Positive in that I was able to go on with life and grown into the experience of having children when I was ready. Negative in that the abortion affected me emotionally and morally. For years I was at odds about my choice and felt an immense amount of guilt and shame for having done so. Recently (within the last 2 months), I read a spiritual book about 'castaway children' and the way that THEY may have been affected by my choice. I hadn't really thought of the child I castaway in that context - it was always 'my life, my choice, my consequences.'

I began to think differently and feel more deeply about the choice I made and began to think and feel from the perspective of the child's rights. It was a deeply moving experience.

I know girls/women who have used abortion as birth control and I don't think that is a good way to approach having or not having unwanted children. I have 3 daughters and I have explained my experiences, my thoughts, and my spiritual belief system with them. I let them know that I would support any choice they would make if ever in the position of being pregnant before they were ready to raise a child. I also let them know that if they decided to have the child if ever pregnant before they were ready to raise him/her that I would find a way to support her in any capacity needed - including adopting the child as my own.

Abortion is a tricky thing and a very personal thing. While I oppose abortions as mindless birth control, I can see where a woman might need to have one. As a mother, I advise my 3 daughters",3,sages

Police need MORE funding not less, the reason we have bad apples is because the jobs aren't lucrative enough on top of the fact that it is dangerous as you never know what might happen to you every day you go to work. If you put yourselves in their shoes for 24 hours even you'd start to understand the real issue is the non funding of the police force causing so many issues.",3,sages
177,Legalization of illicit drugs is necessary to lessen the stigma of substance abuse and so that users who need help with addition are more likely to pursue it. Doing so also greatly reduces the profit motive of illegal enterprise decreasing the associated crime that accompanies the illicit trade. It's also a matter of bodily autonomy and allowing adults to consume the substances they choose as long as it doesn't directly effect others. Taxing the trade will also generate tax revenue that can be utilized on everything including drug recovery programs for abusers.,3,sages
179,"Defunding the police seems ridiculous. Who out there has that much faith in the goodwill of their fellow man that they would believe fewer police would be the right answer? Have you seen these videos coming out of San Francisco where groups of people are going into CVS and essentially looting, while no one does anything to stop them. They have had to close stores as a result. If a business can't operate at a profit, it will shut down. If people are robbing businesses without consequence, then there won't be any stores for people to shop at.",3,sages
183,"Regarding the legalization of illicit drugs, I strongly favor legislation for it, as research indicates several significant benefits of doing so. Resear Legalization allows the government to regulate the manufacture of said drugs and ensure no adulteration, contamination, etc. is present in them, drastically reducing the potentially fatal effects of poorly made drugs. Furthermore, it allows clinics that can oversee the safe administration of intravenous drugs, test drug quality, and provide rehabilitative services, all in one location. With increased access to rehabilitation, the number of addicts will decrease. Legalization will also drastically reduce the number of convicted inmates, who would benefit more from rehabilitation than exploitative punishments. The prison-industrial complex lobbies against legalization of drugs not on moral grounds, but because it is profitable to have as many people to exploit as they can. These institutions also lobby against rehabilitation services, childhood education, etc. and spend very large sums of money manipulating public opinions. The so-called war on drugs mainly exists to perpetuate this system, and only increases the number of people addicted to drugs, which is obviously the opposite of what it claims. Whether or not this is intentional or simply the product of a flawed system is debatable, but it is clear to me that the current laws regarding illicit drugs are grossly inadequate and disproportionately perpetuate stigma and harm towards vulnerable groups, rather than protect people. As such, I think it is a very important moral and ethical problem.",3,sages

192,Abortion should not be legal in most cases. A former wife and myself went through and abortion several years ago and there is not a day that goes by that I don't regret the decision. Our baby had genetic faults and would have likely been still born or died shortly after birth. We didn't have the right to make that decision for a child. My brother had been told something very similar for one of his children and the child was born healthy. I will never know if my decision was the right one to make. Abortion should only be allowed in specialized cases and rape. Not because someone was careless or not prepared for the consequences.,3,sages

I don't think the government should be making decisions for people. That being said, it makes me sad that the babies that are aborted don't get a chance to live. In an ideal world, nobody would have to have an abortion, but I am in support of people being allowed to make that choice for themselves. I also know that there are a ton of children in foster care, and often children are born into bad situations.",3,sages

I'm not religious, like the growing number of people in this country today, and really the singular standpoint on those that are anti abortion are in religious groups that go against their belies. People should definitely be allowed to choose what they want to do with their body, including having children. There are countless examples of the mother having to choose between herself and having a child when pregnant, and with abortion criminalized you're putting the mother's' life at stake. Rape unfortunately is still a prevalent thing in this country and those who are attacked would then be forced to carry a child instead of having an abortion which is a despicable thing to think about. While there are always two sides to every argument, religious beliefs should not be at the forefront of any argument especially in a case as serious as this one as it alienates those who do not follow those beliefs.",3,sages

Even still, I think that my performance on these exams at least partly reflects how I perform in school. These tests are not really any different from school exams, and I still freeze up on those sometimes too. I personally know many students from my high school class who had the same GPA as me, took the same number of APs as I did (if not more), and who worked just as hard as me for their academics, but received a lower score on the ACT/SAT. I also know that these students would be unprepared for the rigor required at the college that I attended, even though the school might have accepted them if ACTs/SATs were not required. While I understand that standardized tests prove a financial barrier for many disadvantaged families, I do believe that they should still be required and that instead we should find some way to make them a more equal playing field than they are currently.",3,sages
208,"I do not believe that illicit drugs should be legalized. It is true that whether legal or not people still use these drugs; however, legalization would make these drugs seem acceptable to use which would increase the likelihood of people using them including teens.

I do not believe we should have the option to kill our spawn so easily. If we make the mistake, or if we are forced into the situation and have a child, we should indulge in the reality and do what is right for that life, not just our own.

When abortion is illegal, there is no precedent to improve upon sexual health and education, and access to birth control is also being restricted, meaning that abortion rates go up.

For a woman with a wanted pregnancy that goes wrong, the agonizing decision about what to do should be hers alone. For a woman (or child) with an unwanted pregnancy, I believe that a living person's life should ALWAYS take precedence over a potential life.

Other cases, like when someone under 18 is raped and becomes pregnant, could result in the person choosing to get an abortion.

The criminal justice system is clogged to the gills with drug cases and getting rid of them will elevate so much wasted time.

The War on Drugs was a terrible initiative that did nothing but boost the black market and harmed communities. You cannot treat addiction by criminalizing their behavior and not providing the correct resources needed. And we all know that the CIA in the 70's or 80's actually tricked Black Americans into cocaine addiction under false pretenses, thus contributing to the drug/crack epidemic we are still seeing today. No matter if they are legal or illegal, people will do drugs for different reasons. But if we have enough open resources away from shame and stigma, more people would be less likely to continue using and more likely to seek help. With sweeping legalization, it would effectively run the Black Market of drugs into the ground, or at least make it much less profitable than it has been. As someone who has gone through trauma, it is really why I hold this view. There is such a misconception about addiction. No one wakes up one day and randomly says to themselves ""I am going to start using heroin, just because, and become addicted to it."" And there are people who can take hard drugs like that once, and never have the pull to do it again. If we start looking as addiction as a symptom of trauma or something greater, and not just a disease, then we will have a greater understanding/empathy for those that are addicted.",3,sages

If the baby is viable let it live why does murder have to be the only option?",3,sages
273,"I believe abortion should be made illegal because I think that sanctity of human life trumps everything else.

I spent many years working in education, special education to be specific, and found that some of the brightest students simply could not sit for a three + hour exam and do well.

In short, we as humans are not standardized so our testing for college entrance should not be standardized either.",3,sages

There need to be exceptions for people with known issues with vaccines, or certain medical conditions, but that covers a small percentage of people.  Having enough people vaccinated greatly reduces the spread of crippling or killing diseases. In time, vaccination campaigns can even eliminate diseases altogether.  Vaccines prevent harm and death and do so in numbers that far exceed negative reactions.",3,sages
285,"I believe that Abortion should be illegal, because I see it as killing a live person. People call the baby a fetus, but that baby has a beating heart. Thats someone that is alive. The baby doesn't have a choice of whether it wants to die or be born. It's innocent in the entire thing. people talk about it being a better choice for the baby. I live with a chronic health condition, are you saying that I should be killed now because then I wouldn't have to live with this? it doesn't make sense. You shouldn't get to kill someone because its not a good time for you. if you are mature enough to have sex you need to be mature enough to deal with the consequences of said actions. Birth control and condoms are out there EASILY available, for free even!",3,sages

It should be up to the mother whether she wants to carry the pregnancy to term, because I don't believe the fetus qualifies as a person up to a certain point in a pregnancy.

Creating an unwanted child creates problems for society, and can be worse than death for the child.",3,sages

That is both an inappropriate legislation based on religion, and also contrary to what science shows. It causes societal harm by having many children born into situations that will not be good for them or their families. The burdens of this policy fall disproportionately on the poor. It revictimizes people who have been raped.",3,sages

We, however, do not live in an ideal world which makes abortion a necessary medical procedure that should not be infringed. There are so many health, social, and economic issues that abortion provides a medically necessary procedure for. I, and most people I would imagine, do not enjoy the idea of abortion or the loss of a fetus that could grow up to be an amazing person. However it's necessary in our society and women do not make the decision to get one lightly. It is a process that is a hard choice but ends up being the right decision for that woman at that time.",3,sages

At the same time, I believe that after the third month it is taking a life and I'm very uncomfortable with that. I feel it should be legal with time restrictions but acceptions for those things I listed above.

Access to safe and legal abortions is a medical right for women to have, and women should have the right to choose. Safe abortions should be available no matter the reason, but especially if it‚Äôs a medical necessity or for rape cases. Children, and especially infants, require a lot of work, time, resources and money that can be unaffordable and difficult for some parents, and abortion should be an option for family planning.",3,sages

Instead of rehibilitating people from substances, we criminilaize people for drug use, especially black and brown Americans. By legalizing drugs in the US, we as a society change how we approach substance addiction and the ways we take care of each other. By legalizing drugs, we also allow for more oversite on substances that go out on the market. This could mean less drug overdoses due to unmentioned Fentanyl spikes in drugs or just due to overdosing in general.",3,sages

We live in a society where diseases spread quickly and globally, vaccines offer the best bet of protection for everyone.   The risks associated with vaccines are very small, but the risks of a highly unvaccinated population are huge.   Small children and some with significant medical conditions can‚Äôt be vaccinated and it would be catastrophic if they caught certain diseases, we have a moral obligation to do what we can to protect them.  Some diseases will also evolve and become more dangerous if we don‚Äôt vaccinate against them now.

I kind of understand why some people would say that we should defund the police. If you look at all of the horrible things they have done, it sort of makes sense.

However, what do you do once they're defunded? The United States, as it is now, wouldn't hold together without the military and police to enforce the will of the powerful on the rest of us. Law and order is how they sell it to us. At the end of the day, it is about control. So if we were to defund the police, who would be the most likely to replace them?

Common sense says it would be the military. In many places police are already being militarized. The end result here is fairly predictable... Before too long, people would be wishing they still had the local cops around. The way I see it, this comes down to a choice between two evils, and in this case I really believe the police are the lesser of the two.",3,sages

But these drugs can be addictive and have been proven to be addictive.,3,sages

If abortion is illegal, women are left to fend for themselves and find unsafe ways to carry out an abortion. Also, a women becoming pregnant does not always become in a safe and consensual way, for example: rape, incest, etc. that has already stripped the woman from her autonomy.

The nation is low and dropping rapidly in education and just having friends abroad, or even interacting globally on a casual scale, is enough to realize that America is more and more broadly considered the butt of the joke. Our in-place systems are failing, both us and in general, and there is only one greater problem (instructor pay) than the standardized test which encapsulates everything wrong.

By forcing students through an ever increasing list of requirements that they MUST know, teachers are often forced to speed through topics in as rote and dry manner as possible just to touch on all of the details. It prevents more engaged approaches towards fields that would benefit immensely from unorthodox/non-standard teaching methods such as the STEM fields, where many people simply do not interpret what they are learning in a way that feels approachable or engaging.

Further more, as the test continues to grow, undue pressure is placed on the students to retain information shown to them in sparser and sparser spans of time. It's doing no one any favors, either as student or teacher, and beyond that, we have continuing evidence that churning out raw test numbers has often only served to cultivate test-taking as a skill set, rather than cultivation of the subject matter itself.",3,sages

There are many drugs that are less harmful, or even beneficial, compared to a common legal drug, alcohol. So while I support decriminalization of drugs and allowance for use in medical research, overall I would like to see policies that reduce the negative impacts of drug use overall, preferring treatment over expensive mass incarceration.",3,sages

As I detailed earlier, I believe forcing women to undergo that experience, or perhaps worse, utilizing unsafe means to circumvent it, does not serve to benefit society in any way. Making abortion harder to access results in more children being born to parents that typically do not have the means or desire to be parents, creating a vicious cycle of neglected children growing up in difficult situations to only to repeat it and very rarely being able to break out of that cycle. It makes society a worse place with no tangible benefit towards that society, only the esoteric one of preserving a human life, if you even believe that.",3,sages

They both should have rights in the eyes of the law and medicine. Of course there will be difficult instances, involving rape or medical issues, and those should be guided by psychiatrists and doctors. If a pregnancy is going to kill or severely harm the mother, then maybe the gentle, loving thing to do is end that life. But we need to stop the rampant killing of inconvenient babies. 

So many abortions are had by people in committed relationships. Moms who already have a kid or two, know how demanding they can be, and chose to continue to have sex and just abort the little sibling. So many people view abortion as just another form of birth control. It's not. The ease of having an abortion shouldn't allow people to feel ok with unprotected sex.

Similar to abortion, a violation of bodily autonomy can be justified when the state has a compelling interest, which in both cases the state has viz public health and the preservation of human life. Even the risk of health effects is no barrier here, as it is, as I recall, settled law that fines for vaccine refusal due to medical risk are allowed.
I support both requiring businesses to vaccinate their workforce, but also fines for the unvaccinated, and potentially jailtime for egregious offenders or inciters such as Stew Peters. While 1A exemptions might exist, the vast majority would not be valid, as few religions prohibit vaccination even when aborted fetal cell lines are used.

Besides the principle that outlawing abortion is sexist and denies women  the choice to make decisions about their own lives and bodies, there are many critical cases in which abortion access is necessary for women's health, safety, and livelihood. Many women face health problems during pregnancy for which they need to have an abortion, so outlawing abortion can lead to the death or extreme illness of those women. Additionally, children and rape victims need access to abortion so that they do not have to experience the trauma of carrying a child to term. Additionally, people should be able to choose to have an abortion if they do not want to experience pregnancy, since pregnancy is incredibly uncomfortable and permanently alters the body.",3,sages

I think that along with affirmative action, there should be programs that help support students with things like mental health, where people give them a direction and maybe even require them to take classes on things like abnormal psychology.

A rich black person is better off than an impoverished white person, but solely race based affirmative action policies ignore this. It can also devolve into quotas which may fuel racism. If someone loses a job opportunity because the arbitrary quota of certain skin color has already been met or needs to be met, that may make them vulnerable to racist propaganda. It may also fail to address core problems.

The first being that a woman's right to choose should always be protected, and violent sexual crimes against women can carry lifelong consequences and reminders of said event. Republicans who vote against abortion rights, mostly men who would never have to experience this personally, discuss the ""sanctity of life"" while also voting to do nothing to help children. Most of this comes from Republicans' religious backgrounds who say abortion is wrong, which shouldn't happen in the first place because the separation of church and state is in the constitution.

There are cases where it is factually, medically necessary. Even a planned, wanted child could encounter problems which may threaten the lives of both said baby and their mother, in which abortion would quite literally save the woman's life.

There are millions of unsafe abortions performed yearly, and this number would greatly increase should a nationwide ban on abortion occur.",3,sages

Making it legal should also come with the addition of many more treatment facilities, which could be funded by the money saved from keeping people out of jail

Longer waits, less beds, increased odds of infection etc. For these reasons you should support mandatory vaccination.",3,sages
468,"I don't support the far right's current drive to criminalize abortion, for several reasons. First, there's a strong moral case to make that reproductive rights are just as important to protect as economic and social rights -- because there's no way to separate them from one another, especially when a woman is faced with a pregnancy that she didn't expect, yet lacks the means to support. I don't believe that 70-year-old right wing males should be making those decisions for them.

Second, I've never been satisfied with the far right's demands for women to carry babies to term, regardless of the consequences -- they always seem to vanish as soon as the baby appears. They make their case even more complicated -- or hypocritical, depending on how charitable you feel -- by lobbying against birth control and prenatal care, two related measures that one assumes would go a long way toward making abortion ""safe, rare and legal.""

Third, I believe that most efforts to criminalize abortion reflect a desire for power and control over the rest of us at any cost, yet such efforts -- as Prohibition, and the so-called War on Drugs, to name two -- have never succeeded in ensuring 100% control over a population that overwhelmingly supports the idea of legalized abortion, with some controls over how and why it should be done. Social resistance would spring up against a federal ban, just as it did against the banning of alcohol in the 1920s, or the attempts to lock down illegal consumption of controlled substances.

Fourth, even if you could completely control abortion through draconian limits, and penalties against doctors for performing it, what's to say the far right's goals would stop there? We saw a glimpse of this last summer, when Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas suggested going contraception and gay marriage. Even if  abortion could be completely and efficiently criminalized, I doubt most of us would want to live in such a society.

Police have been trained a certain way that leads to excessive restraint and shooting to kill as the only tools at their disposal. Instead the police need the same or more funding to examine the issues they face in a more intelligent, balanced, and nuanced way. Perhaps a psychology based unit should be set up to analyze and approach problems with a different set of tools that does not so quickly resort to violence.

Standardized tests are somewhat problematic in that they seem to positively correlate with being of a higher socioeconomic status and being White. The cost can also be exorbitantly high to take the tests and send score reports to relevant institutions. However, fee waivers do exist for students with demonstrated financial need. Further, this metric is objective and standardized across all test takers, which represents the opportunity to compare candidates on the same measure whereas something like GPA could be influenced by the quality of the school a candidate attends. Further, it could represent an opportunity for otherwise less competitive candidates to stand out.

It means that people will seek out unsafe methods to end their pregnancies, which will result in people dying.

I do believe that police and those who are being retained/arrested could benefit from a shifting around of police department funds.  Increase the length, and quality, of recruit training.  Right now, it is awful how easy it is to be given a gun, ammo, badge and car.  Portions of the money can be given to agencies that can assist with the mental and emotional health of citizens.

The court is saying its OK for a single women to be forced to have a baby and then raise it without a father.

Many pregnancies do not go according to plan, and some require the baby to be aborted in order to save the mother's life.  Banning abortions doesn't allow women in that situation to seek help, and puts the mother's life at risk.  Additionally, women that are raped should not have to carry their rapist's baby.  Banning abortion will not actually stop abortions, it will just cause underprivileged women to have to seek them out illegally, which could often be dangerous.  The rich will still be able to fly to a place where abortion is legal to have theirs.  Banning them doesn't actually solve any problem at all, except making the religious feel that they ""saved babies"".

It limits women's access to other forms of healthcare that could potentially be construed as having the potential to abort a fetus. Criminalizing abortion is a way of forcing a certain subset of Christian moral views on everyone, including non-Christians, and as a result defies the supposed separation of church and state.

The small outliers constantly cited (rape, incest, ""health of the mother"") are less than 2 percent of overall abortions. 98% are done for convenience because the culture we live in has treated children as an obstacle to freedom, not the point of existing.

Life begins at conception. To throw one's hands up in a fit and say ""we don't know when life begins"" only validates banning abortion all the more. If we are UNSURE of when life begins, it makes no sense to regulate it other than when we know the pregnancy begins. You are taking a stab in the dark at killing another human being.",3,sages
547,I am morally against legalized drugs. I use to live in WA and watched pot farms go up all over the place. The pot farms smelled terrible and everywhere I went I could smell people smoking pot. My neighbor smoked it and his smoke always drifted into my back yard. I believe pot is a gateway drug and is more harmful than cigarettes to the body. Kids found it easier to get their hands on as it was ubiquitous. People became even more lazy then they already were. During business hours in town I saw numerous male men go into pot shops and then to a game stop. Shameful. I can't even imagine what this country would be like with more dangerous drugs legalized.,3,sages

But when a woman becomes pregnant, I believe in most cases, it is wrong to recieve an abortion and abortions should be illegal.",3,sages
550,"I am adamantly against abortion because I am convinced life starts at the moment an egg is fertilized.

Only women who were raped, or who may have permanent medical harm or death from a pregnancy should have a right to abortion. (I consider incest a form of rape.)  It is only in this case that the ""my body, my choice"" mantra makes any sense whatsoever.

I also believe that minorities disproportionately have more abortions and that is actually by design, if you look at the history of abortion advocacy. This is disgusting.

There are more effective, more moral contraception strategies, and they should be taught to all children, starting with abstinence until marriage, but including condom use, and so on, but people should be taught that they are making a choice if they have voluntary sex, and they should not be allowed to escape that moral choice.",3,sages

600,"I believe that the vaccine mandate issue cuts to the core of what it has meant to be an American and shows the societal undercurrent of dissent on two levels -- that of what is healthy and that of what it means to be free.  It's not a simple question.  There is validity to the notion that a vaccine is of little use, especially in a pandemic situation, if enough of the population doesn't take it.  It cannot adequately protect an individual if that person is one ""dose"" among a crowd of infections.  It's the marginal lessening of huge numbers of people that allow the overall effect to stop the spread of infection.  I see that logic and do not disagree with it.  But the most fundamental truth of being American is to have personal liberty.  An individual has the right to refuse to worship another god, live by another's standards, share another's beliefs and rituals and refuse any body or health related modifications sought by others.  The crux of personal liberty is personal responsibility.  I have the responsibility to carefully consider the state of illness in my world and what the potential costs are for me as I interact with society - including whether to take vaccines.  Personal responibility may lead me to choose for the benefit of my society to take the vaccine.  But the option to not take it has to be there too.  We have to think in terms of the worst case scenerio when evaluating what freedom to lose.  It's true in this situation that vaccines probably are not hurting people and are genuinely the best thing for society and are both created by and controlled by people and instututions who are knowledgeable and well intentioned.  But what if that were not the case?  What if a shady government and/or a shady corporation did produce a sugar pill and dupe the masses into buying it -- or worse, produce a dangerous pill and not warn anyone.  What if a meglomaniac managed to become powerful enough that he could secretly manipulate the situation to spread a harmful drug",3,sages

The baby inside the woman is not part of the woman's body; the baby is a separate entity and just as entitled to life as anyone else. The same people who react with horror to the torture or killing of a defenseless animal will somehow not bat an eye at the murder of a defenseless baby in the womb. Abortion doctors have a lot of euphemisms to disguise the horror of what they're doing (even referring to abortion itself as women's healthcare). One abortion doctor, in disputing someone's claim that the baby screams as it is cut apart, said that was impossible in her case because the first thing she does is sever the baby's vocal cords.

Recently in my city, police departments are given grants and money to buy brand new vehicles, build brand new buildings and host other events. While this can be good at times, I wonder where all the rest of the money is going and how much money is given to the police department. Are these people taking the money for themselves as well? Another opinion I have is that it is probably a good thing to fund the police, because that means they will have less a need to pull Americans over to write traffic tickets because they have enough money. Defunding the police can be dangerous because I feel defunding the police may cause police officers to turn on Americans, leading to more police misconduct and more police-citizen deaths. Police brutality may increase, and America may be at risk for more crime because people will no longer want to work as a police officer because of the defunding.

Black families are left completely incapable of building up even the most basic forms of wealth. There's no reason to save to invest in a newer, more reliable, and ultimately most cost-effective car if their environment destroys it. There's no reason to invest in a local business if shoplifting and blight render it unsustainable.

Ultimately these students wasted time and money going to a university that they did not succeed at, or could not get into the career choice they wanted to at this school. These students clearly would have been better off going to a college with somewhat lesser standards where they could have succeeded in the field they had a strong desire to be in, and would have been extremely successful.  So often white students who were also intelligent, but not necessarily the strongest academic students, did NOT get into the more demanding college (because they did get the bonus of affirmation action) ended up going directly to the lesser college and successfully earning a degree, and then maturing and becoming very successful in their career without wasting time and money at a more challenging school they would not have succeeded at.

When I was young abortion was illegal everywhere in the US. That didn‚Äôt mean there were no abortions. This was before birth control pills. And before sex Ed in schools. It was the days of groping at the drive-in movies.

It was the days of the back alley abortion, when women got infections, or were botched up and made sterile. Or died.

I take a stance that is completely against police defunding. The reasons for defunding I feel have no comparison to the potential outcome of the negative outcome. If the police are defunded it will take away the ability to fight crime completely. Nobody will defund  criminals and they will find ways to arm themselves and the police will have no way to fight back. The criminals would run wild and make the public a completely unsafe environment for the innocent people and the children who have no involvement. The police make errors like anybody else who works and have to make life and deathe decisions in split seconds so they can return home to their own families. They protect and serve the public for the most part and often aren't the most paid. Sone police dealings may be unwarratned or less important but I believe they are a necessary evil.",3,sages

Some people have perfect hair and teeth and physiques while other people deal with physical deformities and mental defects.  Today, its seems like people feel if they cannot give birth to a baby that is 100% perfect they should abort it and try again. This is selfish, this is inhuman, yet the leaders of our country are to the point where they believe if a baby is delivered feet first and then its head is punctured and its brains are sucked out then it was never alive to begin with.  How ANYONE can defend this barbaric practice is beyond me, and yet there are doctors today in other countries who advocate for the, well I don't know how they say it, but they believe in ending the life of a child if it has birth defects.  This lack of respect for human life is scary, it is dehumanizing, and it is a symptom of a selfish and corrupt people. It makes me sad.",3,sages

Sending them to prison turns them into worse criminals and further disempowers them.",3,sages
681,"Students should still be required to take a standardized assessment in order to enroll for college. A timed test gives both students and colleges and universities feedback about students' academic progress. A student does not want to enroll in a university, where costs are very high, if they have little to no chance at having success toward a four-year degree. Spending thousands of dollars and then dropping out of college could have a significant economic effect upon a student's economic future. Saddling themselves with high levels of debt with little to no way of repaying it is not a great way to start out in life. Therefore, students need to see what their progress is in math, English and science reasoning, three skills necessary when attempting to obtain a four-year degree. A decent way to assess students' progress is with a standardized test such as the ACT or SAT. Agencies that provide scholarships also need to see students' skills and who they should invest their money in. A student's ACT score is a good predictor of their GPA in their first semester of college. It is worthwhile both to students and to universities to consider a student's ACT score to help determine whether a student is a good fit for a university or not. The ACT score does not need to be the defining factor in college admission, but it does need to play a part. The more information that is present, the better it is for both the student and the university. We should keep ACT scores in the college admission process to help everyone make good, informed decisions about the future of students!",3,sages

Finally, how can you force people to take a vaccine the producers of which have prosecutorial immunity if anything goes wrong. Didn't we learn anything from the Swine Flu vaccine of 1976?

During the 1st trimester of a pregnancy, the fetus barely has a heartbeat and has not developed hardly at all, which I think should be the timeframe for legal abortions, the 1st trimester, nothing more. I feel it should be legal because there are so many unexpected and unplanned situations that can cause pregnancy, such as rape, the partner not being truthful about using contraception correctly, or even an accident where the contraception has a hole that wasn't seen or noticed prior. These situations, especially a pregnancy caused by Rape should be understood by every human being and should be legal. I think it is absolutely terrible for someone to tell a woman pregnant by a rape ""you cant get an abortion, you have to have this baby"" knowing the baby will potentially be a constant reminder of the horrible experience. Even when its a situation where a teenager isnt smart/careful and becomes pregnant should be legal.

Too many Mother's are killing their children because they don't want the hassles of being a parent. This is rather selfish and doesn't prevent the individual from making poor decisions in the future. If you're not willing or ready to be pregnant, do not have unprotected sex. In the event that you're not careful, one should face the consequences.

This is a more difficult, more labor-intensive, and likely a more expensive approach, but it is also far more fair than any of the crude broad-brush pigeon-holing foolishness that currently applies far too often.
It is indisputable that redress of legitimate grievances that have resulted from prolonged oppression is crying out for corrections to be applied.

It was also originally developed to correct years of discrimination and to give boosts to disadvantaged groups. With the diversity of our society today, it seems that the programs coming with the policy have been successful.

Defunding police departments gives criminals the green light to commit crimes without the fear of any punishment. All one has to do is look at communities where defunding steps have been implemented to know that this is true. In many major cities thieves have been committing brazen robberies of high end stores without any apparent fear that they will be caught and prosecuted. These robberies have caused many stores to close because of financial losses. Violent crime, especially in the larger cities has also increased. Law abiding citizens have a right to feel safe and secure. It is the responsibility of the government to protect its citizens. Defunding the police will do the opposite.

There are so many people who want children, but for medical reasons are unable to conceive.

It shouldn't cost 10's of thousands of dollars to do this or even adopt, many people simply cannot afford that.  Most importantly, God says killing an innocent being is wrong.

Big pharma and their investors benefit heavily while the citizens are tested like lab rats. While the rich get richer, our citizens are left with the choice to risk medical injuries or our jobs. Even practicing freedom of speech and thought has been beaten down with an Iron fist. 
I stand firmly against this.",3,sages
797,I believe abortion is a moral issue and should be legal. It should be a decision left up to the woman/couple and their doctor. I believe it would be dangerous for it to be illegal because it could lead to woman doing abortions at home.,3,sages
798,My most firm position would probably be on abortion. And that's because I'm a male and I feel like one gender shouldn't tell another gender what they can or can not do. Especially since I'll never experience having to carry around a child and the impact that could have on me on my day to day. Also i'll never experience a rape like a woman can. To be raped and to be pregnant with the child of the rapist is an amount of pain I could never fathom.,3,sages
799,Legalization of illicit drugs - I don't think it's a good idea to do it for any man made drugs. The danger is just too high that someone high on illicit drugs will commit a crime. I do believe though that these people should be sent to therapy not to jail unless they commit violent crime or something like that in the process.  Addicts need treatment if they ever hope to get better.  Jail will  not help. There they can continue to take drugs.,3,sages
