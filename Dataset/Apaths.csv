3,"I strongly support abortion as a basic human right. Giving birth is not without risks, both physical and psychological. There are long-term consequences to carrying a baby to term and giving birth. No one should be forced to give birth, because that potential life is not automatically of greater value than the woman who becomes pregnant. When fetal cells cannot sustain life outside of the womb, I see no harm in removing them.",1,apaths
7,I believe Affirmative Action is wrong and should be removed all together.  It provides an unfair academic setting by allowing those that are defined as 'minorities' access based on their skin color and not their academic success.  More people of color are given more chances at things based on their skin color than those who have worked hard to create an opportunity for themselves.  Affirmative Action is not fair and is biased towards Caucasian men and women.,1,apaths
10,"i think that standardized testing should be removed. it puts an unnecessarily high amount of pressure on kids, and forces them to compare one another to each other. standardized tests are simply not an efficient way to measure intelligence (especially considering they're timer). children are not numbers; their strengths cannot be reduced to such. i got what i would call a low score on my SAT and yet i graduated valedictorian and have been consistently on the dean's list. not to mention, people can guess on standardized tests. they're just not a good way to measure the success of somebody. you cannot rely on a three-hour exam to know the brain of an individual.",1,apaths
12,"Legalizing drugs. 

I don't think that legalization of drugs is a good thing. There are too many people that die from drugs. Too many people want to numb their feelings and don't want to deal with everyday problems",1,apaths
14,Abortion should be legal because it is apart of women‚Äôs rights to have access to healthcare. It takes two people to make a baby and a woman should have the right to choose if she wants to carry a baby or not because it is her body. Society views women as a means to an end to keep producing babies instead of human beings.,1,apaths
22,"I choose abortion, because it is a very personal to me. Uterus havers should have a right to their bodies and what happens to them.",1,apaths
23,I think drugs should be legal but treated like alcohol. I think we spend too much money in this fight. I also think drugs like psychedelics could really benefit a certain population.,1,apaths
25,I believe some drugs should be legalized. There are too many people in jail due to drug related charges that should not be there.,1,apaths
30,"I believe abortion should be illegal, other than during a medical emergency. There is free access to all types of birth control and if people choose to not use them, why should they get to end a life because of it? The life of a child is just as important as the life of the mother. Mothers also need access to resources that will help them keep and raise the child.",1,apaths
39,I don't think police should be defunded. This will result in more crime and lawlessness. It is common sense.,1,apaths
42,"I am against mandatory vaccines because I think everyone should have body autonomy.  Although vaccines can help many, they can also be rushed and companies are not held responsible for side effects.  Also many say you can just get a medical exemption if needed (which those with complex medical conditions may need) but any medical doctor who is found to be issuing these are investigated and quickly labeled a quack. The trust the science crowd while having best intentions fails to realize that science is more fluid then fixed and people should have the right to make decisions that could effect their body for a lifetime.",1,apaths
45,"i believe abortion should be legal, as i feel there are already so many unwanted children in foster care systems waiting to be adopted. so if abortion becames illegal, i feel that number would increase, which could also affect the crime rates globally. not everyone is ready to have a child, and in some cases, women have been raped, or had a failed contraceptive measure fail. every women deserves the right in the say with their body. if abortions become illegal, i feel vasectamies should become more mandated.",1,apaths
50,"Vaccine mandates should be implemented. They should be implemented because there are a lot of diseases and illnesses that can be prevented by being vaccinated. Not only that, but if enough people are vaccinated some diseases can be completely eradicated. If everyone isn't vaccinated than the vaccines protective effects are less valuable and diseases can flourish. It's important that everyone is vaccinated.",1,apaths
53,Standardized tests should not be removed from academic institutions. Standardized tests serve as a benchmark for students. Standardized tests also give institutions insight on students' academic ability.,1,apaths
57,"I am 100000000% pro choice because first and for most, it‚Äôs NOT my body so it isn‚Äôt my place to say what someone does with theirs! The world is already too overpopulated and going down the drain, so why do we need to make it worse by adding more children. Let‚Äôs help the children that are born into terrible situations first. There are so many unfit parents who will now be forced to carry a child to term. That will set up the child for a life of potentially poverty and abuse. I could go on for days.",1,apaths
63,"I think illegal drugs should be legalized, with exceptions. There should be a certain amount of drugs that should be accepted. This would save space in jail for those criminals who commit even bigger crimes.",1,apaths
72,"I believe the police should be defunded due to the systemic racism that is impacting not only our country, but the people that are supposed to be keeping communities safe. I think this was highlighted during the George Floyd protest. The police have gotten away with Situations like that, but this instance was finally filmed and brought public. I believe there are many other resources that could be more beneficial than the police.",1,apaths
73,"I think abortion shouldn't be illegal because it makes it more difficult for necessary abortions to happen as quickly as they need to be. Doctors can also manipulate the situation and refuse a medically necessary abortion. Abortion should only be used as a medical procedure when the mothers life is in danger or the child isnt developing correctly. It shouldnt be so widely accessible. It should be accessible as easily as possible when it's medically necessary though, and making it illegal will muddy the waters.",1,apaths
77,I think abortion should be legal.  I feel that a woman's body is their own and that a human should make their own choices regarding whether or not to give birth.  I think that a lot of issues in society are caused by people who were had by parents who were not prepared.,1,apaths
80,I pick the issue about abortion because it applies to me as a woman. I feel like it should be up to each woman to choose what decisions she makes with her body. If someone doesn't want an abortion then they can choose not to get one instead of forcing their religious views on others.,1,apaths
82,I believe the police should be defunded because the police don‚Äôt actually help the general population at all and only serve as a standing army to intimidate the people. I believe we should invest in stopping crime systemically and stopping it before it starts since the police don‚Äôt do that.,1,apaths
86,"I believe that everyone should get vaccinated. Not everyone is able to get vaccines due to health issues so this keeps them the most safe. If the majority of people are vaccinated this also creates herd immunity and certain diseases will become more easily eradicated. Some people do not want to get vaccinated due to religious or personal beliefs. As shown recently, those actions are what drags on things like COVID.",1,apaths
89,"Abortions shouldn't be illegal, all that does it create dangerous ways for women to still get abortions. Men who biologically cannot carry a baby shouldn't determine whether women should be forced to have them or not. There are many reasons to terminate a pregnancy besides life threatening ones and that's okay. There should still be ability to choose. Men can get multiple women pregnant at once yet one a women is pregnant she is out of commission (for a lack of better words) for almost a year, yet we are the ones being controlled. People claim they're pro life but they don't care about the life already here, those in foster care go through hell but they don't care about that, put the baby up for adoption as if it's that easy to even adopt a baby. People have to jump through hoops to prove they can be good parents just to adopt one child so many people don't pass the assessment nor have the patience fr it but you want all these women to have babies they don't want and just shove them in the foster care system. If abortions become illegal then the man that helped make said baby should be forced to take care of the mother & the baby since the women is being forced to have it.",1,apaths
93,"I choose abortion. I feel like the government has well overstepped their boundaries overturning this law. The men that made this decision are disgusting. If it was one of their daughters, sisters or wives who were ever raped, sick or in a predicament where they would need to have an abortion, they would be sick with themselves., These services are something that needs to be available everywhere for women all over the USA.",1,apaths
96,"I believe that drugs should be legalized. The reason I believe this is because people are going to do drugs whether they are illegal or not. So if they are going to do drugs, then you might as well make sure that the  drugs they are taking are tested and regulated. The more regulated they are the less violence surrounding drug trafficking as well. Legalizing drugs would also create a lot more job opportunities, improving the economy. It would also help with the stigma surrounding drugs and I feel that people would be more likely to ask for help if they are suffering from addiction, as well as have more support and understanding from other people.",1,apaths
100,"I think specific drugs should be legalized. For example, cannabis should be federally legal across the board. More states are recreationally and medically legalizing it. There is science behind how it can help medicinally such as cancer patients and for pain management. And it is better than prescription pain killers that contributes to the opioid crisis. Shrooms and psychedelics as well are becoming more popular with helping with mental health issues which is also itself become more of an issues in the past few years.",1,apaths
107,"Making abortion illegal is one of the most abhorrent things you can do to women. Especially when we have bad social safety nets in place, restricted housing, and the highest medical bills in the world.",1,apaths
113,"Abortion should be a legally protected right. The arguments being made about ""killing babies"" is absolutley ridicolous. If a baby is a bay at like 20 weeks and not collection of cells, then take it out of the mother..... Yeah, its not a baby. To force a person into delivering a human into this world is not only medically dangerous but mentally devastating. The united nations labels forced birth a s a war crime. Quite frankly, I agree. Taking away abortion is a slippery slope to taking away more and more rights from women. This ""debate"" is only a debate because of evangelacist christians who believe in every baby being born.... until that baby is born and forget about them. I can event describe how scared I am for the future oif this country.",1,apaths
115,I think vaccines should be mandated to help stop the spread of diseases.,1,apaths
118,"I believe abortion should be legal. In certain cases, it is what's best for the physical and/or mental health of the person getting. it is also simply the person's right and choice what happens to their body and not anyone else's. Having a child is a world-altering event and should not be a choice to be ripped away.",1,apaths
121,"Standardized tests should not exist anymore. I firmly believe that it is unreasonable to use a score from a single exam to determine eligibility to enter a school. For example, what if someone has good grades but they do very poorly on the standardized exam? They don‚Äôt get to go to a good school because of a test? I also believe that grades shouldn‚Äôt be a determining factor for intelligence because numbers do not define people.",1,apaths
124,"I feel like abortion should be legal because it's a woman's choice whether she wants to go through the complications of childbirth and the struggles of raising a child because 7/10 the if the parents are split, the child goes with the mother.",1,apaths
129,I feel that mandating vaccines is a breach of our personal choices we should be allowed to make.,1,apaths
130,Drugs I‚Äôm pro it because if you listen to a lot of research microdosing has really saved a lot of peoples lives and make positive changes to your daily life.,1,apaths
134,"I believe the abortion should be legal because not only does outlawing it go against the constitution, it also results in the deaths of countless women. In the constitution they say that church and state are to be seperate. Fetuses are only considered people under modern Christianity, and thus this violates that construct. Beyond that, many women die during childbirth, and know they will in advance.",1,apaths
135,"I believe America should defund the police. There are so many injustices taken place where people of color are being attacked due to oppression as demonstrated by police. Evidence proves giving more money to the police, worsens the situation for people of color and perpetuates racism. This situation has affected me at a personal level where cops are incredibly oppressive for very minor offenses. Ordinary people should not have to lose their lives over cops that take no accountability for their actions.",1,apaths
137,"Defund the police. They don‚Äôt need so much money, when other areas like education are so low on cash. Them having all of this money also is what makes them so powerful, which can lead to racist actions being swept under the rug",1,apaths
141,I believe abortion should be legal for a plethora of reasons. Not everyone should be forced to be a parent if they dont want to be and women who have been sexually assaulted should not feel the pressure of having to carry through a pregnancy they dont want. I would prefer children be born into situations where they are loved and welcome and if that means a clump of cells in a small sac have to be destroyed then so be it.,1,apaths
142,"Defunding the police. I do not believe that we should defund the police because it does not seem to target the source of frustration for many people. I believe that greater training, more effective background checks, and greater resources would likely result in police forces that are more prepared to engage with the public and deescalate tense situations without the use of lethal force. These improvements require greater funding, not less.",1,apaths
146,"I support a vaccine mandate while allowing for minimal exceptions based upon medical criteria. No religious exemptions. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing and additional, more contagious variants keep appearing because so many people have not received even one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. It is a public health crisis that affects our most weak and vulnerable, elderly and low income. How we treat the most vulnerable members of our society says a lot about our society.",1,apaths
148,"I think that all drug use should be legalized, but selling hard drugs should remain illegal. I believe resources are better spent trying to help addicts rather than put them in jail. I think that some drugs are arbitrarily banned when the effects of alcohol are so much worse.",1,apaths
150,"I fully support legalizing abortion again. I think that the government should not be able to control and regulate the ability for women to do things to their own body. Pregnancy is dangerous in some situations, and can affect women physically and mentally, taking a huge toll on their body. Forcing women to give birth can injure and sometimes kill them. You should never regulate something like that",1,apaths
153,"Legalizing abortions : against 
As a women that does not want a baby, if I accidentally get pregnant I works like to have an abortion. If something goes wrong in my pregnancy I would like to have an abortion. I think women should be able to have the option to have one if needed.",1,apaths
160,"The topic I choose is defunding the police. I think defunding the police will reduce them just accepting anybody as a cop and will make sure they take people who are dedicated and have the passion for the job and protecting the lives of the citizens also, if they get defunded then it means many people will lose their jobs and the streets won't be safe anymore. There will be increase in crimes and loss of lives so to me I think they shouldn't be defunded but instead, there should be good training and management to bring out the best in them.",1,apaths
165,"Abortions should be legal for everyone. When safe abortions are available you don't have to get one if you don't want to or don't agree with it. Removing access to abortions all together is harmful to anyone who may want one someday. There are countries where abortions are illegal and you can check their statistics, they still try to have abortions and many times the pregnant person is harmed or even killed. If abortions are made illegal then financial support must be provided to the person giving birth and/or orphanages and foster homes.",1,apaths
166,I think drug use should be legalized with controls. Much like Amsterdam drugs are available to adults. There will be a drop in drug related crimes. It is up to the adult to use and a real abuser cannot be stopped with penalties. We need to trust society to police themselves. Alcohol is legal and the vast majority of people don't drink themselves to death.,1,apaths
167,"Defunding the police. While I get the reason some people have. Mainly  to give less power to the polic, I think that is a horrible idea. The police are what protects us the people and upholds the law. It make little sense to take away funding that they may need to protect human life.",1,apaths
171,"I am writing about making illicit drugs legal. I do not agree with legalizing illicit drugs. Right now, as it is, people are abusing drugs and dying from overdosing. They do not need for illicit drugs to be legalized just so they can abuse them and go too far with them. Some people don't know when to quit/when to say ""enough is enough"" (some people do). Since not everyone knows when ""enough is enough,"" illicit drugs should not be legalized since they can be abused.",1,apaths
173,My position in standardized testing is that I think they should have tests for students to allow them to see if they are ready for college and allows them to see where they stand with verbal and math.,1,apaths
178,"This War on Drugs will never end unless we decide to make drugs legal. Let the government get the tax money from all the drugs that are bought. I've been successful with alcohol, with marijuana. Is the time to just legalize all of the drugs so we won't have as much crime. There will be more tax money to use for the homeless battered women missing people",1,apaths
180,"In regards to vaccine mandates, I hold the view of opposition. The main reason I hold this view is because people should ultimately have the freedom to decide what goes into their body. Also, there could be moral and religious conflicts depending on the vaccine type as well as long-term side effects that weren't properly accounted for during the development and testing process, although typically low-risk. However, I am not opposed to certain places requiring vaccines to be on premise and around vulnerable people, such as hospitals or nursing homes.",1,apaths

186,I believe that abortion should be Legal. I dont believe that anyone should have legal authority over anyones body but the women involved with the abortion. I believe that women should be allowed the ability and anononimity,1,apaths
187,One of the issues were about abortion being illegal. My position is that it should be legal because it is a woman's choice to go through that process since it is her body. I do think there should be a certain term that is considered to far in to follow through the process.,1,apaths
190,I do not think vaccinations should be forced upon us. I think I should be able to decide what goes into my own body. We have no idea what are actually in these vaccines and what harm they may do to us in the future. That should be MY decision.,1,apaths
191,"Vaccinations are important for the overall health of society. I understand parents that refuse, because I also have a kid that has adverse reactions, EVERY TIME, and has even ended up in the ER multiple times after a vaccination. However, he lives. And he helps his community by being immunized against the things can can threaten it, and the lives of his friends and himself. we sometimes delay a vaccination, and as an honesty-check, he still can't get his Meningococcal B vax because it shuts his system down for some reason and we end up having to have him admitted, but he gets every vaccine he can. his brothers will not be at risk because we all stay vaxxed in this house. When pandemics happen, or epidemics, or flu season, we all minimize contact and get what we can for shots that are recommended, because it's not about just us. If it was, I would never put my son through the stuff that makes him so sick and scared sometimes after a shot. but it just isn't all about him, or me, or our comfort. It is about all of us.",1,apaths
193,"I strongly support a mandatory vaccine mandate because when infectious diseases become a public threat, the vaccine is the only way the public can recover and go back to normal fast. If everyone in this country is vaccinated, they will be less likely to catch and spread the virus to other people. And vulnerable people who catch the virus will be less likely to be gravely ill and spread it to other people. We've seen vaccines work before with Polio and they are safe. However, when only a bit more than half of the population of a country is vaccinated, those who are unvaccinated will keep on catching the virus and spreading it around, potentially spreading it to vulnerable people who even after getting vaccines still have a low immune system, such as people with transplants, cancer, etc.",1,apaths

197,"I think the majority of drugs should be legal. The government does not get to take away freedoms of someone to their individual body regardless of societal consequences. The idea that by putting away drug users (non violent, or violent) we are significant increasing safety with society is propaganda to silence those who are screwed by the system. So their credibility and power is taken away. Drugs do not have as big of a negative impact as society and the government makes us what to think. The real causative negative impact on our society comes from big corporations and WASPs.",1,apaths
200,"I am for defunding the police IF that means money is directed to programs and people called in place of the police for calls that deal with mental health issues or other de-escalatory type situations. I do not believe Police should not be eliminated entirely as power vacuums only encourage more violence. Police officers should be trained like nurses, doctors, and other professions, out of their own individual pockets so that when they are on the job they have thoughtfully prepared and lead with measures to deescalate incidents and use force only when necessary. I believe this because I have two family members that are LEOs and I have heard a lot about the culture fostered in police forces. They are militarized and have an Us VS. Them mentality that leads to violence over de-escalation and is born from lack of deep training and police culture.",1,apaths

210,"I can't understand a world in which drugs could be legal, though it depends on the drug. Something dangerous like meth should never be legalized. It sets a horrible precedent that we can't control a problem and so we just legalize it. Drugs are dangerous for the users and for the people having to interact with the drug users. Making it legal will expand access and make the problem greater. There is no societal ""good"" to most illegal drugs. This isn't something like alcohol, that can be used in moderation and safely.

Unfortunately, not all drugs are created equal. Things like opiates don't genuinely help people. They either make you so numb to your depression you feel okay living, or they aid people in a lot of pain who are dying to die a less painful death. Neither of these are permanent solutions, though the latter is more understandable. After that, they are not a solution for temporary pain, because they are so highly addictive, and most people don't know if they are susceptible to becoming addicted... until they become addicted.

I would be very scared to live in a world where our police have been defunded. They do a hard job that a lot of people would not be willing to do. I don‚Äôt know very many people who would be willing to put their lives on the line for the pay that they get. If anything the police should be paid more. Anyone who thinks the police should be defunded is because they live a life of crime and not wanting to follow the rules.,1,apaths

Don't want the baby - give them up for adoption, but DON'T KILL! Now they are legalizing ""post-birth abortion."" Do I need to even comment on that?? SICKENING!!",1,apaths

659,"I will talk about the vaccine mandate and how I feel about it. I don‚Äôt think that a vaccine should ever be mandated. I think that it‚Äôs my body and I should have the choice to do what I want with it and particularly in recent times with Covid, and this vaccine that got created in a very short period of time and basically got use on the public as a rat experiment is a perfect example of why I don‚Äôt agree with a vaccine mandate. My own mother got the Covid vaccine and she has had several side effects from it, including being sent to the hospital because her blood platelet levels dropped to zero. The doctors ran every test possible on her and the only conclusion they could come up with was it was a side effect from the vaccine she received a few days before, the only reason my mom got that vaccine is because she needed it to leave out of the country. It was a requirement and because of that she almost lost her life and she is still dealing with multiple side effects. After doing research about the particular Covid vaccine that she took, there are several studies now showing this happening in women her age and there‚Äôs nothing she can do about it because the companies are protected from being sued. The problem she‚Äôs having now are very worrisome and she‚Äôs only 55 years old.  This is a prime example of why I don‚Äôt believe vaccine should be mandated.",1,apaths

I am okay with abortion being legal for people who have become pregnant from rape, incest, or if it saves a mother. In those extreme cases, or maybe even if the child will have extensive difficulties surviving. Otherwise, it should be illegal. It just seems ridiculous people can commit legal murder because they couldn't control their ability to have sex or at least use protection...

I think that is why it needs to be the people's choice on whether or not they want to get it. To have your life threatened if you don't get a certain vaccine is unconstitutional. And not everyone can medically receive vaccines, and no one should harass others on whether or not they have received it. Now, I understand how you can't go to other countries in place",1,apaths
