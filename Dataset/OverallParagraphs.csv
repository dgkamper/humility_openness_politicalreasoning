ID,Paragraph1,"Defunding the police is important to me because I have lived in poor communities where I have seen the violence perpetrated by police officers on a daily basis. I have also been in communities where the police were not called and issues were able to be resolved without their involvement and due to not involving the police, less violently. I am also a communist and believe the police exist to protect capital, so less of them benefits my political goals."2,"I am pro choice. A person with a uterus’ body is their own, not the governments. No one should have a say with what I do with my body. Abortion is healthcare and is necessary for emergencies and also just for people who accidentally get pregnant and don’t want to keep it."4,"Standardized testing is important. It helps provide more data on how well students are learning certain subjects and how well they can apply what they learn to relevant problems or questions. There are many different types of standardized tests and they all have different categories. No one is going to be perfect in every subject, but these tests can help determine a student's eligibility for college admission, as well as see what areas they may fall short in. Standardized tests should not be eradicated."5,"I chose the legalization of abortion. I fully believe it should be legal across the board. It is important for the safety of people with uteruses. People deserve full rights and autonomy to their bodies. There are tons of children in foster care that are not being adopted, there is no reason to add more to that. There are health concerns involved with pregnancy. At the end of the day a person deserves a choice"6,"I personally believe that people should be vaccinated. So many people died before they were made that wouldn't have if that technology was available. It's a minor inconvenience to keep yourself, your family, and everyone around you safe."8,"Drugs should be legalized.  Drug prohibition has lead to increasing profits for drugs cartels.  Take that money away from the cartels, and law enforcement. and put it towards drug rehab and mental health counseling."13,Affirmative action should continue because there is still a lack of minority groups in positions of power. Affirmative action ensures that doors are opened for all groups to be successful.15,"Abortion:
Abortion should not be entirely illegal. When the life of the mother is at stake, she has priority over the unborn child. This includes things like ectopic pregnancies, which no one considers a viable pregnancy. However, the number of abortions being done has become alarming. We have proof that research organizations are illegally paying to request certain organs for research and are illegally cooperating with groups like Planned Parenthood to supply these organs from abortions. 

Rather than promoting pregnancy prevention among women, we have opted to provide cheap and convenient access to abortions. Abortion is the one medical procedure that is not required to be reported and does not have to follow basic medical standards such as access for emergency personnel and equipment. Women have died because of this refusal to be accountable for a medical procedure. Also, because pro-abortion groups don't want to admit that abortion can have severe emotional impact on a woman, many refuse to offer post-abortion counseling. 

I am fully in support of free birth control for any woman who requests it. That would help cut down on the need for abortions and the mental, physical, and emotional effects that can follow an abortion."17,"For the time being, I believe affirmative action should stay to at least some extent. There are too many minorities afflicted with generational poverty and a distinct lack of opportunity. The poor and disregarded should be lifted up and encouraged. There are inequities in our society that will have to be addressed through action. Affirmative action is one of these. As our society becomes more fair, we can begin to phase it out."18,"I think affirmative action should not be dissolved because America is not yet in a place where institutions that currently are impacted by affirmative action can guarantee equality. Affirmative action was created as an artificial mechanism to guarantee equality and increased diversity in certain institutions because we as a society are not yet in a position to do so ourselves. This equality and increased diversity must be protected because, as evidenced by backlash against movements like Black Lives Matter and the prominence of racism in the United States, we cannot guarantee this equality and diversity alone."19,I believe the police should be defunded to give other groups and organizations more public funding. Police do not need tanks and military grade weapons to do their jobs and we should focus more on community programs that prevent crime all together rather than funding an organization that reacts to crime after it has already happened.20,"I support defending the police because police are trained to be far too violent. People, especially people of color, who are in distress are often shot or battered by police instead of being helped. Having social workers respond to domestic violence calls or suicidal people would be more effective, and could potentially save taxpayers money. People think that police won't be able to respond when they are needed, but that is incorrect. First of all, basically nobody is calling for police to be completely defended. We just want them to spend less money on literal tanks and more money on helping people. Also, we all saw what happened at the school in Texas. Police, even when funded, often are too cowardly to do anything."24,"I want to write about the standardized tests. I think they should be abolished in favor of something different. It seems to me like the testing companies have states/schools/etc by the cahonies. Myself and my kids were all terrible test takers, yet we all have done fine in life. Just because someone is a good test taker doesnt mean anything, and just because someone is a bad test taker, that doesn't mean anything either."26,"Abortion

I am very pro-choice and DO NOT believe that abortion should be illegal. The decision as to whether to bear a child is one of the most important a womxn will make in their life. Women should not have to explain why they don't want to carry a child and should be given the option of termination regardless of the reason. In extreme cases of rape and incest, carrying a child can be traumatic. The outlawing of abortion will only force women to subject themselves to unsafe means to terminate a pregnancy, increasing the rates of female mortality. Further, an embryo or fetus can not survive on its own when removed from the women's uterus; thus, it should not have the same rights as a full-fledged human being."28,"I strongly support the legalization, regulation, and taxation of psychedelics and barbiturates. The legalization of marijuana in Colorado generated millions in tax dollars, deprived mexican drug cartels of billions of dollars, supported local entrepreneurs, and standardized a safer product."29,I think keeping standardized testing in place is best for poor and low income students who may struggle with grades and being able to be involved in extra curriculum activities and this tests allows Lemon ability to set them selves apart in this context. I think a lot of times people think this will help them I think actually it stripped of their abilities to leap forward32,"Removing standardized testing is something I feel personally about because I struggle with test anxiety and understand how stressful they can be. Some students take this test so seriously and use it to determine how smart they are, how skilled they are, and what they’re worth. I feel strongly that these tests do more harm than good and should be discontinued."33,"As I stated previously. Abortion should be every woman's personal choice. A choice they have already been making for themselves for decades. Some crusty, old, straight, white man in a position of authority has no right to decide what a woman can or can't do with her body. The minute that right is taken away they will start to think they can (as they have already shown they want to) take away the rights of other groups of people."34,"I think abortion is a way more complicated issue than people outraged about it present. Both the mother and fetus are human life. Both deserve to live. Sometimes that's not possible for health reasons. In the future birth control will be widely available and pretty much fool proof so abortion rates will be null to minimal. We'll look back 100 years from now at pro-choice as barbaric, but we don't live in the future yet, today abortion is still a very necessary evil."35,"I think at the point that vaccines were shown not to prevent transmission, the idea of a vaccine mandate should’ve been eliminated. There’s no benefit to workplaces, as anyone, vaccinated or not, can spread Covid. Since it doesn’t prevent getting Covid either, it shouldn’t be mandated. At this point, the only thing it does is prevent severe Covid, if it even does that. If they want to risk their health, that should be someone’s choice. No one’s outlawed cigarettes or fast food, and those kill millions every year."36,"Abortion should NOT be illegal: 

There are many situations in which abortions are the only option for a woman. That choice should not be taken away from a woman as it is her body and her decision. If we as a country advocate for the separation of church and state why does the same argument not apply to this matter? There are so many situations in which women or young girls have been sexually assaulted or raped and now have a child that they are unfit to carry. Should be stuck with a child that is a constant reminder of the trauma that she endured. Just because abortions are illegal does not mean that women will not find other (potentially much more dangerous) ways to stop their pregnancies. We as a country are moving backward rather than progressing forwards."37,"There are no good outcomes to taking drugs recreationally. An addict is still an addict whether the drug they took is legal or not. People say that there would be less crime if drugs were legalized, but someone who is stealing to get money for drugs will still do that if the drugs are sold at CVS. Their lives will still be ruined by addiction if the drugs are legal. They still put themselves and other people in danger with their behavior under the influence. Many of the drugs that are illegal, including ones people consider harmless like marijuana, can cause psychosis. A society full of people getting stoned is never going to be a good society."38,"I hold the stance that illicit drugs should NOT be legalized because I see absolutely no positive outcomes for people who use illicit drugs. They kill people, destroy families, and break hearts."40,"Standardized tests are used in college admissions to gauge where applicants stand in the applicant pool. Students apply from a variety of different schools, and school districts. Research has shown that standardized tests are only able to predict performance of the first year of college at best.  Past grades are better in predicting students' future success in a college setting."41,"Standardized testing offers a clear assessment of a students progress or not.  It also by drilling down shows his/her school success or failure to educate this student.  It also charts our students progress and success against other countries students.  We can see, with accuracy, whether our educational system is properly preparing our students for both academic and real world success in a globalized economy and ever more connected world.  Removing these standards doesn't help current or future students as we don't know how successful they are in school or whether their schools are just passing them along from one grade to another or they really are successful in a challenging academic environment.  Standardized testing should be kept to help measure progress, success, and failures of both students and their schools."43,Defunding the police would be a bad idea because it will lead to a surge in criminal activity which will  make the streets less safe and lead to more deaths from violent crimes like shootings.44,"Abortion should be legal because the majority of Americans want it to be. There should be no question that if the case of health of mother, incest or rape the fetus should not have to be carried to term. I would also add if the baby cannot survive outside of the womb. 
The majority of arguments against it are religions based ethical or moral arguments. Religion has no place in politics."46,"I believe that vaccines should never be mandatory.  The ""science"" behind them in shaky and unreliable.  They have never done a true vaccinated vs unvaccinated study for any of the vaccines.  They hide adverse reactions and blame them on other things.  Most vaccines don't even prevent the disease they are supposed to."47,I believe mandatory vaccines are the safest and most logical way to keep our population safe from disease and to also protect those that immune compromised.48,"I oppose abortion. I think it's philosophically unjustifiable and the arguments, like Judith Thomson's, are unsound. It is not a matter of ""bodily autonomy"", because the child also carries that autonomy. All opposing arguments I've encountered are fallacious."49,"Vaccine mandates.  I'm all for it, and I don't see how any rational, reasonable person wouldn't be.  Why put yourself and your family at risk?  When death is involved, why would you knowingly choose that fate?"51,I support the legalization of drugs. I feel that most importantly it is the individuals right to decide what substances they ingest and for  what purposes. I believe that the war on drugs has been largely ineffective much like the prohibition of alcohol.52,"Defund the police is not actually “defunding” it means to restructure and hold accountable. Police do not prevent crime anyway. They need to be better trained and need to be a diverse group. They need to be held accountable when they commit crimes- they also need to be held accountable financially by paying these huge lawsuits out of their own pension funds, NOT from taxpayer money."54,The legalization of abortion is an issue that I care deeply about. It is not only a medical necessity in our society but it broached on our need for bodily autonomy and what can be at risk without legalization. Making abortion illegal wouldn't stop abortions from happening it would only mean that safe abortion would only be available to people with means and would be unsafe for everyone else.55,I support continuing affirmative action because the work of social justice isn't done. Under-represented populations continue to need prioritizing to try to help make up the ground lost by years of racist systems and attitudes. It's a moral issue.56,Abortion should not be illegal.  Women should be able to choose whether or not they have one.  I had an abortion when I was 22 to a man who was abusive and would have used the child against me.  I do not regret a single thing about it.  I'm so glad I had that choice and it was mine to make.   I support that right for everyone.58,"I believe affirmative action should be removed with student race not being a factor in the admission process, with past academic success and potentially being the primary factor into acceptance/rejection. If universities and politicians want more people of color to be accepted into top universities on merit alone more funding needs to be available to ensure all students regardless of socioeconomic background have an equal chance of succeeding rather than just meeting a quota."60,"For anyone who ever planned on caring enough to reevaluate their positions on this matter, it's not difficult to discover why psychoactive chemicals have ever been banned in the United States. It hasn't usually been about popular consensus. Instead, it's usually ultimately revolved around corporate interest. 

The simple fact is that even upon perusal of most ingenuous anti-legalization literature, studies are referenced which demonstrate the pervasive inaccuracy of most anti-legalization claims: the ""slippery slope"" fallacy, the fear-mongering about stoned drivers wreaking incessant havoc on public roads, and so on. It's all heavily dramatized or just plain wrong.  

Even acknowledging that some civil and criminal issues will pop up as a result of legalization, there is no concrete reason whatsoever for substances like alcohol and tobacco to be legal, while less harmful substances still incur legal wrath.

Drugs other than marijuana, more harmful ones, should still be legalized, although regulated much ore tightly. A portion of people will always be drawn towards hard drugs; them doing so outside the confines of the law destroys society without the framework to repair it that legalization could provide."61,I think mothers should have the ability to choose to get an abortion. This is important because it's her body and she needs to have said choice if it is necessary.62,"Standardized tests should be removed. They have been proven to both be an inaccurate measurement of educational ability and have also been proven to unfairly favor white people. They also provide zero benefit, as they are just an arbitrary measure of intelligence and doesn't actually demonstrate any real-world ability."65,"Illicit drugs should not be legalized at all. While marijuana could enhance public health, people will abuse the  legalization. Crime and violence will increase caused by drug addicts, and local governments would have to increase spending on law enforcement to control it. It also makes it way easier for adolescents to get access to these drugs. Most illicit drugs, such as cocaine and opioids don’t even have any health benefits anyway, and will only do harm."66,"I think vaccine mandates are important. They are preventative, ideally, and not reactive to a problem. Many are concerned with side effects and fundamental attacks on their bodily autonomy, but the greater good outweighs these concerns, and legal recourse does exist if the entity mandating the vaccine fails to ensure its safety. There are generally too many people in the modern world, who all live too closely to one another in urban centers, literally akin to animals. Vaccines prevent disaster in such communities and mitigate risk of unnecessary death. They also ensure the safety of children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised who are not always able to protect themselves. To defy that point, at the very least, is immoral, and those who disagree share the culpability of murderers."67,"I believe that ""defunding the police"" doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of law enforcement but rather redistributing money and resources and making room for additional social services to respond to 9-11 calls that don't need police intervention. This will free officers up to respond to the more dangerous scenes where suspects may be armed or an ongoing crime is happening. Moreover, when somebody is having a mental health crisis or there's another situation which needs a calm, de-escalating response, people trained to handle those types of situations--without weapons blazing--can respond to those."68,"Vaccines are an important requirement. They not only protect you, but also others."69,The legality of abortion. I feel abortions should be legal. The government has no right to govern a women's body. Men are not held to the same standard and women do not create children on their own. A women should have the right to choose what to do with her own body.70,"We shouldn't defund the police because a lot of black people are getting killed by police. While racism exists, the issue is more about class. Poor people are killed by police, not just blacks. Many blacks happen to be poor, so we confuse the issue. The police do a lot of important work. We should spend more money giving them better training. We can save money by giving them fewer weapons."71,"When it comes to the issue of defunding the police I am slightly leaning towards that ideal. The social issues that are brought are due to the police not acting the way they should be. More violence has been created because of police not listening and not doing their job correctly. Last of all, this isn't just due to social issues, recently with the Robb Elementary school shooting the lack of police effort was a huge deal that caused an issue worldwide about realizing that the police aren't taking measures to protect communities like they are supposed to and rather harming them more."74,"Drug legalization would put less people in prison, create a large surplus for taxes in many states that would likely put up government owned drug dispenseries. This could be used for the greater good, better roads, schools, healthcare, among other things. More freedom for people, is generally good, some drawbacks could occur with more addiction and dependencies on the population, but at the same time some drugs that are illegal now across the country are showing in studies to be effective at treating certain mental illnesses and other physical illnesses."75,Abortions should be legal to anyone because it is a women’s choice what to do with her body and the government should not be able to tell someone what they have to do with their own body.76,"I believe that standardized tests should not be a part of academic admissions criteria because the practice prevents many bright, hardworking students from participating in these programs. We have learned that tests are not the gold standard for evaluating a person's intelligence, as psychological, social, cultural, and economic factors all have an impact on test-taking abilities, particularly when the tests are designed with a particular bias towards a certain population. If we want to grow as a nation, we need an educated workforce, and that means opening up educational programs to learners of all types."79,"I am pro-choice when it comes to abortion. Right now I do not believe I would ever have one, however, I have never been put into the position where I had to think about abortion as an option. I do believe it should be an option available to anyone in an adverse situation, but I do not believe it should be used as a form of birth control. There should be a time limit you should not exceed unless medically necessary for the mother or fetus. There should be a limit on how many abortions you are able to obtain in a certain time."81,I believe vaccines should be mandated because they help stop the spread of horrible diseases that can wipe out millions of people.84,"Out of the three, I am most passionate about the defunding of the police. In my community, the police are absolutely useless. They accomplish almost nothing and in fact, make many situations worse. My town just spent millions of dollars opening a brand new compound for the local police because their current station wasn't massive enough - meanwhile, there are little to no mental health resources in the community, and our schools are suffering by being underfunded."85,"I believe that standardized tests are an important part of college admissions. They were originally a way to directly compare students from different high schools. Without a standardized system, students from highly ranked high schools have a big advantage in the admissions process."88,"The SAT/ACT tests being removed from college admissions is something I strongly oppose. Everyone I knew studied extremely hard for this tests and the ones that put in the work got the right results. People who claimed to be bad test takers happened to be the people who didn’t care about them at all. They measure basic knowledge as well as ability to prepare and perform under pressure. It’s definitely difficult, but helps prepare students for difficulties they’ll face in college."90,"I do not support defunding the police, because I believe that it promotes crime. However, I do support police reform and actually having checks of power on the police especially when it comes to racial bias. This is because I do believe there is a problem with police brutality and racial biases, but I do believe we still need the police."91,"I believe that vaccines should be mandated because they keep our communities safer while particularly protecting the most vulnerable people in a population. It is our duty as a society to do what we can to keep our communities healthy, and mandates ensure this by normalizing this view. The pandemic has shown that a large proportion of Americans will choose to act selfishly given the choice, and personal freedom can only stretch so far when lives are at stake."92,"I am deeply conflicted on the subject of abortion. I look at my children and grandchildren and cannot comprehend anyone killing a helpless infant.

That being said, I am appalled and disgusted by what I view as completely hypocritical and shameless pandering by the GOP to the minority Evangelical “ Christian ultra right.

I recall that Hitlers Germany was a Christian country.

I strongly object to political hacks forcing laws to pander to a minority"95,"Defund the police- I don't support a total defunding of the police, but I feel police departments get an outsized proportion of funding in most municipalities/states. Police have proven themselves to be incapable of deescalating and resolving many issues like domestic disputes, mental health emergencies, minor traffic violations, drug use, etc. Police often create worse outcomes for those situations and then after they kill someone for no reason, the organization will pay millions of dollars in damages to the families/victims. Excess funding should be removed from police departments to come up with better programs/solutions/responses for those types of problems and let police focus on violent crimes, sexual crimes, theft, white collar crime etc. We should also stop funding the damages that come from lawsuits from their mistakes, that should come directly from the officers involved and the department's police pension/retirement fund."97,"Abortion- I have no opinion on this, it isn't for me to debate the issue, I do not vote as I believe one vote does not matter and the opinion of one person matters very very little in a population this size. Thus I don't care about it."98,"I think vaccines should be mandated because people should not be able to walk around freely spreading a preventable disease.  Nobody's personal beliefs are more important than the medical science.  If people choose to not be vaccinated they shouldn't be allowed in schools, offices, stores, etc..."99,"Making abortion illegal.  I have strong stances on this topic as I believe in a woman's right to choose.  There are many circumstances that need to be considered when a woman is making the choice to maintain a pregnancy that are not always black and white.  Many circumstances can lead to a dangerous position for the woman and even death.  Not only extreme circumstances such as death are to be considered but also socio economics.  If a woman is living in poverty, she will continue to live that way if she is forced to raise a child.  Then, that child will be raised in poverty and a cycle will continue."101,"Why should abortion be legal? Women should be in control of their own bodies. A fetus is not a living person and the actual mother's life should be considered of more value. Abortion can be beneficial as a life-saving procedure. Very few women are choosing third trimester abortions except in life-saving circumstances, and so the issue applies only when the fetus is much smaller. Women should also have confidentiality about these medical procedures, which goes away if abortion is outlawed. We are effectively denying women their liberty by restricting access. And, many will still get them anyway, but via much less safe procedures."102,"Defunding the police is a catchall for the worries people have about police abusing their power. Also, the funding they receive has mostly been spent on militarization of the police force rather than focusing on community involvement and more caring approaches to law enforcement. Police are often, rightfully, seen as bullies and the massive funding the departments receive is a major reason behind this. I think that it is important for police departments to work with the community rather than fighting it and while I think that funding levels should not actually be cut but repurposed to better serve the communities, however unless that change is mandated it is unlikely to happen, so I support short term defunding to get police departments more in line with what their goals should be."106,"For vaccine mandate, I support the vaccine mandate because it reduces hospitalization and disease severity which helps to end the pandemic."108,"I think abortion should be legal. I hold this position because bringing a new human into the world is life-altering for everyone involved, and no abortion access causes more harm than it solves. Every child deserves to be born to a loving and safe environment. Every person with a uterus deserves to decide if they will continue a pregnancy or not. Pregnancy also carries a lot of medical risk, and abortion is a lower risk than pregnancy."109,"For whether standardized tests should be used in college admissions, I am unsure where my position lies because it is a complicated issue and I can see both sides of the problem. On the one hand, studies have shown that standardized tests may discriminate against students who are less well-off because they don't have the resources needed to succeed as well, and the tests are not an accurate reflection of the totality of student ability, but on the other hand, some sort of metric is needed to understand an applicant's ability in certain academic subjects, at least for some programs, and having more information about a student's strengths and weaknesses can be helpful."110,"When it comes to SAT's being removed, I think that they should. The reason I think that is because there is many other ways to test a student's ability and efficiency on how well they perform and they could be good in many other areas and just an overall bad tester due to anxiousness, overthinking or any other reason. This shouldn't be the make or break for a student in the future, Especially when it gets up to the college level."112,"I believe that drugs should be legalized. Far too many people are incarcerated for drug use and related crimes. Legalizing drug use would allow law enforcement to focus on more important matters, allow prison overcrowding to be alleviated, and allow for additional tax revenue to flow into government coffers. It would also allow people to decide for themselves what they put into their bodies. Alcohol, cigarettes, and bad food are not outlawed for adults, so why should drugs they are willingly choosing to take? Time to let people make their own decisions."114,"Affirmative Action.
as a visible POC myself I really do not like Affirmative Action. it is unfair to hold people accountable today for what MAY have happened to someone who looks like you decades or centuries ago. we should strive to judge people based on what that specific person does. I do not want people thinking that I have my job because of Affirmative Action or that my kids got into college not because they were qualified but because of the color of their skin. anyone who talks about ""equality"" and is for this racist program is a hypocrite and a liar. I want people to be judged the way MLK did - on the content of their character and not on the color of their skin. it is especially strange because a person who just came to this country can be considered ""oppressed"" and a ""victim"" so they get special rights that a poor person living here their whole life never sees."122,"I strongly support defunding the police, which is divisive in part because of the connotations that phrase implies. I don't think police should be abolished, or that they shouldn't be armed. What I do support is using part of their budget to hire qualified mental health professionals that can handle non-violent emergencies. It would reduce strain on the police department, who can better focus on violent crime, and help prevent needless escalation of situations that, more often than not, can be resolved peacefully by a social worker. These programs already exist all over the country, and the vast majority require zero police backup and save the police department thousands of dollars."123,"I’m a big advocate for the issue of abortion as I believe that there are many mothers who are victims of rape and could potentially be killed from having a baby, so it should be readily available. Additionally, children should only be brought to this world if they will be loved, which isn’t often the case as women who can no longer abort may be incapable mothers."125,"Drug legalization
I believe drugs should be legalized. The War on Drugs was lost decades ago.  The drug market is now controlled by criminals.  If legalized, less adulterated drugs would probablly be available. We could free up resources to treat mental health.  Drug laws have been disportionately enforced upon minorities"126,"I believe drugs shouldn't be legalized. In fact, I'm of the controversial opinion that we should further restrict currently legal drugs (marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco -- I say make the legal age 26, after your brain has fully developed). 

I have a lot of medical personal in my family, so I often get told of the latest studies of the effects of drugs. And not just 1st hand but 2nd and 3rd hand as well in the case of smoking. These things, when not administered by a doctor to treat a specific condition, are very hazardous and impactful. Therefore I say that people shouldn't be using them to self-medicate and especially not for a pleasurable high. 

Now I also understand that legalizing them would allow people to be more safe when using them. That is an important argument, I lost a cousin due to a drug he illegally bought containing fentanyl instead of what he thought it was. But I still think we shouldn't be encouraging non-prescribed drug use. In my cousin's case, he couldn't afford prescribed pain medication for a back issue, so I think we should instead start lowering medical costs by restructuring the insurance industry."127,"Abortion should not be illegal. It should not be a crime. In this modern day, women and people able to have children, shouldn’t have restrictions put on their bodies. There are so many different scenarios I can think of in which it should not be illegal. There are way too many people out there who are not yet financially responsible or capable of raising a child. Let’s not forget the ones who had a child forced upon them. It isn’t fair. Everyone should have rights over their own bodies. It’s 2022 and it feels like they are trying to go back in time. It’s not right."128,"Abortion is a very hot topic currently, and it has meaning to me for multiple reasons. Firstly, I'm not a fan of government control; I believe certain things need to be controlled, but this isn't one of those things. Secondly, Mother mortality rate during illegal abortions is horrific and the law doesn't stop them from happening. Thirdly, I don't believe all fetuses have the right to live if they greatly impede the mother (I won't be elaborating at this time, but this is a huge gray area that shouldn't be black and white.) Lastly, I'm in support of abortion if it's to prevent absolute suffering of the fetus."131,"I feel it's important for the police to be well funded. Otherwise, they will have insufficient resources to protect people with. Additionally, the police force may be less motivated to risk their lives for less pay. If the police get defunded, the local government will be to blame if lives are lost because of it."132,"Because multiple-part abortion is legal only in certain circumstances, most states allow it if the pregnancy is the result of rape, if it puts the woman's life at risk, and when the abortion is accidentally induced, 2 In the public discussion, the points of view indicated usually conflict and this is evident in the situations where the subject acquires preponderance in the media."133,"Abortion should be reserved only if the mother's life is in danger.  Aborting fetuses is basically murder since the age of viability is irrelevant and just a flimsy excuse to go ahead and end an otherwise healthy pregnancy.  It should not be allowed even if women say they have rights to their bodies since the fetus is ""another? life to consider in the choice of the mother."138,"Police should be defended because they have been given far too much money in order to become more militarized. Police should be funded enough to protect and serve but not like a military. Additionally, money could be used to fun community outreach and mental health services to respond to appropriate situations that don't require an armed police presence. Police officers also tend to be under-educated compared to the level of decision-making that goes into their profession. Teachers require more education and they aren't usually responsible for life and death decisions."139,"The reason I slightly support mandated vaccines is because I know they are for the greater good and help to control/eliminate diseases in our community. However, I am pro choice, and even though I don't agree with someone not getting vaccinated, it is a core belief of mine that no one should tell you what to do with your body. It's your choice and shouldn't be forced upon someone."140,i think defunding the police is something that should be considered. the money can be reinvested in the community and help those who need it so they don’t end up needing the police. there can be a creation of a newer law enforcement because the current one is structured within a corrupt and racist institution. the current system gives regular people power over others in an unsafe and gross way that cannot be taught away.144,"Defunding the police is perhaps the most ludricous issue of the three presented.  This has bubbled over not kust to police departments, but also to extemded to soft on crime prosecution. While I am for doing what we can to help mentally challenged people overcome their issues to become better citizens, the exploding crime rates and lack of prosecution for crimes in many large, democrat-run cities is proof that this concept simply does not work and was not well though out from the onset."145,I am pro-choice on abortion because I don't think religious beliefs should impact someone else's right to necessary healthcare treatments. I find it absurd that religions and governments think they have the right to control someone else's choices about their body.151,"Defunding the police is a very difficult and complicated policy. On one hand, we have to demilitarize our police forces. They are not the military and fighting wars, yet they are outfitted with weapons of war, but not properly trained to handle much of what happens in the streets with emotionally disturbed people, domestic disputes and low level crimes such as drug possession, homelessness and shop lifting. They must absolutely be retrained and re-educated to handle the majority of their daily duties. More outreach to social workers and child services instead of armed conflicts. At the same time, we cannot allow armed criminals to take advantage of changed policy, so a hardcore element of crime fighting is still required."152,"I suppose the biggest issue is on abortion.  I don't feel like the Supreme Court should so easily have turned again Roe v Wade and took away the constitutional right of women to have an abortion.  I am not a woman, but if I were a woman, I would feel like my country has turned against me.  I don't see why the Religious Right has such a strong hold in the Republican party.  Also, I think it is such a misjustice that a woman would lose her life because of health concerns that could be alleviated if she were to have an abortion.  I think it's horrible that Texas allows people to sue one another over abortion when it has nothing to do with that person.  I do think that abortion should be controlled on some level, but definitely it shouldn't be taken away and laws put into place that don't take into account a woman's life situation."155,"I feel that abortion should be legal up until certain period. Woman or people with uteruses who have the ability to get pregnant should be in control of their body and to force these people to go through something that is life changing and can uproot everything is irresponsible and not humane. Our country doesn't even provide a great life for people who need help when they get pregnant and need to raise their children. It would be one thing if this country provided the basic for children and babies to flourish but this country doesn't provide that and sometimes, feels like they purpose are ruining children's lives. Additionally even if the government provided support, they should not be telling people what to do with their bodies. Some of these people might not have wanted the pregnancy whether it was due to accidental pregnancy, getting raped or have health complications that may affect the pregnant person or the baby in utero and to force them to go through pregnancy and birth is so irresponsible and evil. The government doesn't govern men's bodies and only wants to control women to keep them down."156,"I am pro-choice to my dying breath. No one should be forced to have a child, whether or not they had consensual sex or used birth control or not. It isn't fair to the mother, it isn't fair to the child, and it's not fair to the father either. Children should not be used as tools of punishment for a woman having sex, and women should be allowed full bodily autonomy like men do. We cannot force dead people to donate organs to save the lives of others. Women should not be forced to allow a fetus to occupy their body."158,"I support mandatory vaccination because this is a very important issue today because diseases are spreading faster and faster and are evolving so we must all be protected to avoid further contamination and also to protect those people who can not be vaccinated, this also helps to avoid a major economic collapse and will allow children to be more protected against new diseases in the long term."159,"Abortion, it’s murder. You are killing a child. I always believed it was murder, but I also respected those who chose to have an abortion, it was always their choice, but it was choosing to kill a child. When states started moving to infanticide, I believe they woke a sleeping giant. They went to far, your choices whee wrong no."161,"Abortion on the whole should be legal. While it is understandable than people would see a fetus as deserving of protections, on the whole I think a woman's right to make choices about her body is greater. I would support abortion bans at later stages of pregnancy"162,"I believe that standardized testing should not be mandatory. I think that state standardized tests should not be hung over teacher's heads as a looming threat. There should be another way that states confirm that teachers are doing their jobs well, such as each student reporting on one thing they learned a lot about in each subject every year, or teachers providing evidence of their student's progression through the year. I think that federal standardized tests like the SAT and ACT should be options for students who want to go to college and prove that they are proficient in test taking, but I do not think they should be required, regardless of whether or not the student has an IEP or 504 Plan. I think these things because tests are not always a good representation of intellect of students, or of the skill of teachers. Some students could know all of the information in the real world, but fail the test, while other students could ace the test because of pure luck."168,"I believe that governments should not have the authority to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body, especially if the health or life of herself or her potential child are at risk. Being forced to give birth to a child with birth defects only for them to die a painful death shortly afterwards would be far more heartbreaking than getting an abortion. I believe many of the negative viewpoints concerning abortion are perpetuated by harmful stereotypes. The majority of abortions are performed due to perfectly valid health or economic reasons. Nobody should be forced to raise a child they are not prepared for."169,"In my opinion, I think that abortion should be a law accessible to people because in these times there have been a large number of unwanted pregnancies, this in turn would generate a great satisfaction for people who do not want to have a baby."170,"abortion ban
abortion should not be legalized. it should only be allowed in the event the mothers life is in danger. abortion is morally wrong"172,"I am opposed to abortion in all cases including in the extremely rare cases where a baby has an abnormality making it incompatible with life.  This includes anencephaly, trisomy 13, trisomy 18, etc.  In this case, as opposed to an abortion, I'd prefer the child simply be delivered prior to viability so that they suffer less or not at all.  If it is past viability, allow them to be born and diet in their own time.  The same principles apply when the mother's life is at risk.  Simply deliver the baby when necessary and let the chips fall where they may for the baby.  There are no other cases in which a mother cannot have the baby and then place it for adoption."174,"As a woman, the issue I most identified with was abortion. Having experienced an abortion and afterwards having four beautiful and wanted children I can see both sides of the issue.

On the one side, I, like many other girls/women got pregnant way too young. I was not equipped mentally, emotionally, or financially to have a child at that time so I made a hard choice. Having made that hard choice had both positive and negative consequences. 

Positive in that I was able to go on with life and grown into the experience of having children when I was ready. Negative in that the abortion affected me emotionally and morally. For years I was at odds about my choice and felt an immense amount of guilt and shame for having done so. Recently (within the last 2 months), I read a spiritual book about 'castaway children' and the way that THEY may have been affected by my choice. I hadn't really thought of the child I castaway in that context - it was always 'my life, my choice, my consequences.'

I began to think differently and feel more deeply about the choice I made and began to think and feel from the perspective of the child's rights. It was a deeply moving experience.

I know girls/women who have used abortion as birth control and I don't think that is a good way to approach having or not having unwanted children. I have 3 daughters and I have explained my experiences, my thoughts, and my spiritual belief system with them. I let them know that I would support any choice they would make if ever in the position of being pregnant before they were ready to raise a child. I also let them know that if they decided to have the child if ever pregnant before they were ready to raise him/her that I would find a way to support her in any capacity needed - including adopting the child as my own.

Abortion is a tricky thing and a very personal thing. While I oppose abortions as mindless birth control, I can see where a woman might need to have one. As a mother, I advise my 3 daughters"175,I think drugs should be legalized and regulated so people are responsible with them. You should need a prescription for certain drugs.176,"I think defunding the police is one of the worst takes of the modern era. Everything it is supposed to accomplish it will make worse. Police need MORE funding not less, the reason we have bad apples is because the jobs aren't lucrative enough on top of the fact that it is dangerous as you never know what might happen to you every day you go to work. If you put yourselves in their shoes for 24 hours even you'd start to understand the real issue is the non funding of the police force causing so many issues."177,Legalization of illicit drugs is necessary to lessen the stigma of substance abuse and so that users who need help with addition are more likely to pursue it. Doing so also greatly reduces the profit motive of illegal enterprise decreasing the associated crime that accompanies the illicit trade. It's also a matter of bodily autonomy and allowing adults to consume the substances they choose as long as it doesn't directly effect others. Taxing the trade will also generate tax revenue that can be utilized on everything including drug recovery programs for abusers.179,"Defunding the police seems ridiculous. Who out there has that much faith in the goodwill of their fellow man that they would believe fewer police would be the right answer? Have you seen these videos coming out of San Francisco where groups of people are going into CVS and essentially looting, while no one does anything to stop them. They have had to close stores as a result. If a business can't operate at a profit, it will shut down. If people are robbing businesses without consequence, then there won't be any stores for people to shop at."183,"Regarding the legalization of illicit drugs, I strongly favor legislation for it, as research indicates several significant benefits of doing so. Resear Legalization allows the government to regulate the manufacture of said drugs and ensure no adulteration, contamination, etc. is present in them, drastically reducing the potentially fatal effects of poorly made drugs. Furthermore, it allows clinics that can oversee the safe administration of intravenous drugs, test drug quality, and provide rehabilitative services, all in one location. With increased access to rehabilitation, the number of addicts will decrease. Legalization will also drastically reduce the number of convicted inmates, who would benefit more from rehabilitation than exploitative punishments. The prison-industrial complex lobbies against legalization of drugs not on moral grounds, but because it is profitable to have as many people to exploit as they can. These institutions also lobby against rehabilitation services, childhood education, etc. and spend very large sums of money manipulating public opinions. The so-called war on drugs mainly exists to perpetuate this system, and only increases the number of people addicted to drugs, which is obviously the opposite of what it claims. Whether or not this is intentional or simply the product of a flawed system is debatable, but it is clear to me that the current laws regarding illicit drugs are grossly inadequate and disproportionately perpetuate stigma and harm towards vulnerable groups, rather than protect people. As such, I think it is a very important moral and ethical problem."184,"I think that legalizing the use of drugs can seriously harm our society and especially the new generation of young people since this type of substance, many of them hallucinogens, seriously affect the cognitive abilities of human beings and also affect their health in general. general. Drugs should only be used in certain clinical cases that warrant it and under no circumstances should consumption be allowed for recreational purposes."189,"I believe that affirmative action is important in our society as it provides a framework that grants opportunities to people who may not have otherwise. I do think its not perfect in its current form and could be improved and updated. We do need over site in its application and how its applied in different areas since like anything else it can be discriminator within groups it applies to. Since we can't know who the next person to advance us as a species will be. I believe everyone should have the same access to chance to grow, learn and work."192,Abortion should not be legal in most cases. A former wife and myself went through and abortion several years ago and there is not a day that goes by that I don't regret the decision. Our baby had genetic faults and would have likely been still born or died shortly after birth. We didn't have the right to make that decision for a child. My brother had been told something very similar for one of his children and the child was born healthy. I will never know if my decision was the right one to make. Abortion should only be allowed in specialized cases and rape. Not because someone was careless or not prepared for the consequences.196,"I feel abortion should not only be legal, I feel that it should be free (as should all basic health care). There is NO 100% effective method of birth control, and even if there were, rape happens. More importantly, MISTAKES happen. I don't think there should be judgement on why one wants an abortion--simply give the woman back her bodily autonomy."198,"I believe that abortion should be up to the mother and that women should have the right to do what they want with their bodies. I don't think the government should be making decisions for people. That being said, it makes me sad that the babies that are aborted don't get a chance to live. In an ideal world, nobody would have to have an abortion, but I am in support of people being allowed to make that choice for themselves. I also know that there are a ton of children in foster care, and often children are born into bad situations."199,I believe that drugs should be legalized. It’s time for the pharmaceutical companies to stop taking money from its patients. It’s proven that drugs such as marijuana and psilocybin have been positive in the treatment of mental illness. These are also natural elements from the earth versus chemicals made in a pill.203,"The topic of abortion to me, as a man in the US, is a strong one. I'm not religious, like the growing number of people in this country today, and really the singular standpoint on those that are anti abortion are in religious groups that go against their belies. People should definitely be allowed to choose what they want to do with their body, including having children. There are countless examples of the mother having to choose between herself and having a child when pregnant, and with abortion criminalized you're putting the mother's' life at stake. Rape unfortunately is still a prevalent thing in this country and those who are attacked would then be forced to carry a child instead of having an abortion which is a despicable thing to think about. While there are always two sides to every argument, religious beliefs should not be at the forefront of any argument especially in a case as serious as this one as it alienates those who do not follow those beliefs."205,"While I firmly believe that vaccines are helpful and valuable, I don't believe that mandating them will promote anything good. In the long run it will cause so much division and animosity. It would be much more advantageous for the scientific and medical community to be completely transparent about the pros and cons of vaccines and thoroughly educate people about vaccines instead of forcing."207,"Although it is a complicated issue, I do not think that standardized tests should be removed as a requirement for college admission. I am now in my Masters, and have taken the ACT, SAT, LSAT, and GRE, all as a relatively good test-taker, but I still get anxiety sometimes that causes me to freeze and panic and lose time during the test. Even still, I think that my performance on these exams at least partly reflects how I perform in school. These tests are not really any different from school exams, and I still freeze up on those sometimes too. I personally know many students from my high school class who had the same GPA as me, took the same number of APs as I did (if not more), and who worked just as hard as me for their academics, but received a lower score on the ACT/SAT. I also know that these students would be unprepared for the rigor required at the college that I attended, even though the school might have accepted them if ACTs/SATs were not required. While I understand that standardized tests prove a financial barrier for many disadvantaged families, I do believe that they should still be required and that instead we should find some way to make them a more equal playing field than they are currently."208,"I do not believe that illicit drugs should be legalized. It is true that whether legal or not people still use these drugs; however, legalization would make these drugs seem acceptable to use which would increase the likelihood of people using them including teens. The increased usage of these drugs in the population will cause all kinds of problems -- most likely cause a significant increase compared to now. Crime would most likely go up, for example, as people who may not be able to afford their drug habit attempt to find money for it."209,I think affirmative action is a positive things to have overall and allows people who come from less than fortunate or marginalized backgrounds have access to opportunities they wouldn't be able to get a hold of normally because of the systematic racism that's a core factor in this country from the start. Hold this view mainly because it's just the right humane view to have for equality211,I think certain drugs should be legalized for the thing is that it help with pain.212,I strongly oppose mandatory vaccinations because I feel it takes away our right to choose and our freedom.218,"I think illicit drugs should be decriminalized. The war on drugs has been an epic failure; a waste of money and has put a lot of people in prison who have only been drug users.  We have stigmatized drug users as criminals instead of treating drug use as a social issue to be dealt with.  More people die from alcohol than drugs, and no one bats an eye at that.  Legalizing drugs and allowing people to have access to clean supplies and not reusing needles and not getting drugs laced with fetanal or other dangerous substances would be a net positive.  In addition, drugs can be taxed to pay for drug treatment programs."220,Legalization of recreational drug use. I don't support it because it affects your mind and your not a 100 percent there. Also will probably lead to more accidents because of an altered state of mind.221,"Standardized testing should be removed from the public education system because it does not actually represent a student well. The S-A-T and A-C-T are such broad tests that it doesn't actually pinpoint or centralize a student's strong point and instead allows for test-taking skills to be more important than high school success or individuality. Overall, one test should not hold so much weight when it comes to a college admissions decision for a student."223,"I believe that a woman should be able to choose to have an abortion anywhere in America for any reason. Every person should have bodily autonomy and not be forced into medical procedures against their will. Being pregnant and giving birth is brutal, and if a woman doesn't want to go through that, they should have the right not to."224,"Abortion should be legal because the government does not get to decide what someone does with their own body, especially when it only affects them. Women will die and children will be unwanted or born with disabilities because a few people in high positions feel its murder."226,"I strongly oppose making abortion illegal. I believe every life has the chance to live no matter the circumstances. Yes a 14 year old can be raped and forced to have a child, and maybe that 14 year old is completely unfit to be a parent. In that case there should be a program set up for adoption into a family that cannot have children. That child will be loved and cared for. I do not believe we should have the option to kill our spawn so easily. If we make the mistake, or if we are forced into the situation and have a child, we should indulge in the reality and do what is right for that life, not just our own. We cannot only think of ourselves in the moment. Not to mention, population is decreasing. We need more babies."227,I think that vaccines should be mandatory because it will protect our older population and sickly people because there will be less disease circulating.  We might even be able to get rid of certain illnesses to some degree.  School students will likely be able attend more days of school and the school system in general would be healthier if vaccines were mandatory.235,"My answer for all three of these is always going to fall along the lines of ""I'm not a terrible person and i don't want others to suffer more than necessary"" but specifically in regards to vaccines, both myself and my family are immunocompromised and have to rely on herd immunity to survive"237,"I have a slightly positive view towards affirmative action.  But the standards need to be applied fairly and the results need to be reviewed often.  If it’s found that certain minorities are given advantage over others, that wouldn’t be fair.  I would be concerned that individuals  who have worked hard to get to a certain position may feel slighted if a minority is bumped ahead or even level with someone who has been a dedicated worker for many years."242,"I believe a woman should always have a right to choose. It is her body, and no one should be able to control whether she has a baby or not."245,I think that abortion should be legal everywhere because it’s a woman’s body and no one should be in charge of it besides her. Making abortion illegal will definitely and has already cause more harm than good. More women will die as a result of performing at home abortions. More children will end up in foster care because people who don’t want children are being forced to have them.246,"I strongly believe that abortion should be legal. The fact is that when abortion is legal, abortion rates go down, because there is more sex education and information about what will happen. When it is illegal, there are back alley abortions that are dangerous and unsafe and many times end up in the death of the mother. When abortion is illegal, there is no precedent to improve upon sexual health and education, and access to birth control is also being restricted, meaning that abortion rates go up. Aside from this argument, I don't think the government has the right to force a woman to carry a child for 9 months that she does not want. Childbirth and pregnancy are traumatic and not every woman wants to be a mother."247,"I believe drugs should be legalized federally because in the current state they are illegal in most states, and this creates only a larger drug abuse issue, resulting in more overdose deaths. If they were distributed by an agency and tested for safety, the deaths would decline. This would also create the opportunity to help the users get rehabilitation treatment and promote a safer and healthier lifestyle for them."248,"I strongly believe that all illicit drugs should be legalized.  Those who use these drugs, will gain access whether the drugs are legal or illegal.  With it being legal, there is better regulation which leads to safer use.  Alcohol was once banned, and is now legal.  It has terrible health effects, but is seen as neutral since it is legal.. as with many prescription pills.  However, almost all drugs have bad health effects. Some illicit drugs like mushrooms can actually be beneficial, though.  Therefore, why should a handful of drugs be deemed bad and illegal, when there are plenty legal drugs that have lasting negative effects?"251,"I favor legalized abortion in all circumstances because I believe that decisions about abortion should be made between a woman (or child) and her doctor. I believe that life begins not at conception, but at first breath when a child can live independently of its mother. Before that moment I believe that the fetus is simply a part of its mother like any other organ or group of cells. I also do not believe that any pregnancy is ended casually. For a woman with a wanted pregnancy that goes wrong, the agonizing decision about what to do should be hers alone. For a woman (or child) with an unwanted pregnancy, I believe that a living person's life should ALWAYS take precedence over a potential life. I do not believe that a child should be forced to carry a baby conceived by her father, her brother, her uncle or a stranger. I believe that the first priority should always be given to the health and well-being of the pregnant woman or child."252,The police should be defunded because their massive budget could be more productively used to fund other government facilities that would have a more positive impact on the country.256,I believe vaccines mandates should exist because it improves health and prevents the spread and evolution of dangerous diseases. Those who are infected with the vaccine will face a weaker virus compared to those who are not vaccinated.260,"I think standardized testing is a good idea in principle, but is in no way a true measure of intelligence/capability. The ability to memorize a set of very specific facts and score high on a test doesn't demonstrate actual application of those abilities and fluid intelligence. Additionally, having the tests be something that needs to be paid for ($50-$70) makes it inherently biased towards more well-off students. This is discriminatory against poorer students and limits equal access to education, which subsequently influences college admissions/access to degrees, eventually contributing to societal imbalances where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer."261,"I support affirmative action as it is designed to eliminate unlawful discrimination among applicants, remedy the results of such prior discrimination and prevent such discrimination in future."262,If they ever try to mandate vaccines this person is not having it!!!!265,"I support making abortion legal. There are many reasons why someone would want an abortion; not all of them involve not wanting to have a child in the first place. Other situations, like having a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, sometimes necessitate having a medical procedure, which is categorized as an abortion, in order to safely remove the baby and/or save the mother's life. Other cases, like when someone under 18 is raped and becomes pregnant, could result in the person choosing to get an abortion. Essentially, I believe that nobody should be forced to have a child is they don't want it. Nobody should be forced to go through pregnancy and/or birth. Making abortion illegal takes away a woman's right to choose."266,"Legalization of illicit drugs. Since Seattle gave the greenlight to every type of drug, places that I used to have fond memories of have become unrecognizable. There are groups who have zero respect for those around them leaving paraphernalia in public spaces and once high they tend to have unpredictable behavior. The governments of cities like this tend to turn a blind eye to these populations and protect them over innocent bystanders that are victimized by them. I have yet to see a cleanliness around needle exchanges, safe houses, etc. If it becomes more difficult for children to get alcohol than illicit drugs where the origin is a mystery will only exacerbate this issue."267,"I believe that making drugs legal will have a dramatic effect of the black population, the criminal just nice system and the health care system.  Since it has been proven that black and brown people are much more likely to be arrested for drug offenses and when they do get harsher penalties, making drug legal will take that completely out of the picture.  The criminal justice system is clogged to the gills with drug cases and getting rid of them will elevate so much wasted time.  The health care system, while it will have to take the brunt of this transition, drug use and addiction should be handled as a health care issue anyway, so this is just putting it where it belongs in the first place."268,i think abortions should be legal because it's the women choice abort the baby. their body their choice.269,"Making illicit drugs legal. I am a firm believer that we should go the exact opposite way than we have gone. The War on Drugs was a terrible initiative that did nothing but boost the black market and harmed communities. You cannot treat addiction by criminalizing their behavior and not providing the correct resources needed. And we all know that the CIA in the 70's or 80's actually tricked Black Americans into cocaine addiction under false pretenses, thus contributing to the drug/crack epidemic we are still seeing today. No matter if they are legal or illegal, people will do drugs for different reasons. But if we have enough open resources away from shame and stigma, more people would be less likely to continue using and more likely to seek help. With sweeping legalization, it would effectively run the Black Market of drugs into the ground, or at least make it much less profitable than it has been. As someone who has gone through trauma, it is really why I hold this view. There is such a misconception about addiction. No one wakes up one day and randomly says to themselves ""I am going to start using heroin, just because, and become addicted to it."" And there are people who can take hard drugs like that once, and never have the pull to do it again. If we start looking as addiction as a symptom of trauma or something greater, and not just a disease, then we will have a greater understanding/empathy for those that are addicted."270,"I believe standardized tests should be removed because they mainly hurt poor students. Testing performance is heavily impacted by the resources available to the student: tutors, college pre schooling, special courses. Theses resources are not available for many low income student. Additionally, students who are well off can solely focus on test preparation whereas other students may need to work or help at home."272,"Abortion is wrong in every way. A human life should be protected at all costs and respected. It ultimately is a reflection on how little human life has value in our society unless we can personally get something from them. Abortion highlights the most barbaric attributes of any society and cannot be justified in any way. People like to always bring up misarranges and delivery complications, but that doesn't mean it has to end in a deliberate abortion. If the baby is viable let it live why does murder have to be the only option?"273,"I believe abortion should be made illegal because I think that sanctity of human life trumps everything else. I believe that the pro-life stance is progressive because it grants every human being, even those at different forms of human development, the right to life. One doesn't loose their ""humanness"" at any stage."276,I believe that drugs should be legalized. It would lessen the drug wars and would lead to less needlessly jailed people. A person should be allowed to do with their body what they want.277,"Standardized testing
I believe that standardized testing is not an accurate reflection of a students knowledge. Some people don't test well. Some have learning disabilities that make testing hard. There are other ways to get an accurate picture of a students overall knowledge and other factors to consider."283,"I am opposed to standardized testing. I spent many years working in education, special education to be specific, and found that some of the brightest students simply could not sit for a three + hour exam and do well. Yet these same students could excel in debate and mathematics and so on when given the additional time they needed to perform to their level of ability. In short, we as humans are not standardized so our testing for college entrance should not be standardized either."284,"I think that vaccine mandates are good for populations.  There need to be exceptions for people with known issues with vaccines, or certain medical conditions, but that covers a small percentage of people.  Having enough people vaccinated greatly reduces the spread of crippling or killing diseases. In time, vaccination campaigns can even eliminate diseases altogether.  Vaccines prevent harm and death and do so in numbers that far exceed negative reactions."285,"I believe that Abortion should be illegal, because I see it as killing a live person. People call the baby a fetus, but that baby has a beating heart. Thats someone that is alive. The baby doesn't have a choice of whether it wants to die or be born. It's innocent in the entire thing. people talk about it being a better choice for the baby. I live with a chronic health condition, are you saying that I should be killed now because then I wouldn't have to live with this? it doesn't make sense. You shouldn't get to kill someone because its not a good time for you. if you are mature enough to have sex you need to be mature enough to deal with the consequences of said actions. Birth control and condoms are out there EASILY available, for free even!"286,Abortion should be legal because no one should be barred from medical help because of someone else's religious beliefs. The fact that it's even a controversial topic and that women are being kept from getting abortions shows just how backwards and horrible our country is.287,I support Affirmative Action because it addresses historical racism.  It attempts to bring equal outcomes to different groups who have traditionally been under represented.  It recognizes institutional racism and attempts to correct it.288,"Abortion should be legal up to a certain point. It should be up to the mother whether she wants to carry the pregnancy to term, because I don't believe the fetus qualifies as a person up to a certain point in a pregnancy. Women should be free to do with their bodies as they choose. In many cases, carrying a pregnancy to term risks the mother's health. Creating an unwanted child creates problems for society, and can be worse than death for the child."292,"Abortion should not be illegal. It removes women’s right to control their own bodies. Prohibiting abortion is based on the religious view that life begins at conception. That is both an inappropriate legislation based on religion, and also contrary to what science shows. It causes societal harm by having many children born into situations that will not be good for them or their families. The burdens of this policy fall disproportionately on the poor. It revictimizes people who have been raped."293,"abortion should be legal, because there is a clear need for them, when the women go through them. However, counseling should come with the intent to abort."299,"I will be writing about abortion. In an ideal world, abortion would not need to be legal and even if it was it would never be used. We, however, do not live in an ideal world which makes abortion a necessary medical procedure that should not be infringed. There are so many health, social, and economic issues that abortion provides a medically necessary procedure for. I, and most people I would imagine, do not enjoy the idea of abortion or the loss of a fetus that could grow up to be an amazing person. However it's necessary in our society and women do not make the decision to get one lightly. It is a process that is a hard choice but ends up being the right decision for that woman at that time."301,Mandatory vaccines. I am against that as people should be able to decide on what they put in their body302,"My feelings on abortion are very mixed. I believe it should be legal because there are times it's a terrible necessity, such as rape/incest and the life/health of the mother of the fetus. At the same time, I believe that after the third month it is taking a life and I'm very uncomfortable with that. I feel it should be legal with time restrictions but acceptions for those things I listed above. It should be okay to do at any time for any reason, I favor improved birth control over abortion."304,"I believe that abortion should be legal because making it illegal does not stop determined women from seeking abortions. Access to safe and legal abortions is a medical right for women to have, and women should have the right to choose. Safe abortions should be available no matter the reason, but especially if it’s a medical necessity or for rape cases. Children, and especially infants, require a lot of work, time, resources and money that can be unaffordable and difficult for some parents, and abortion should be an option for family planning."305,"Abortion should remain legal.  Nobody should own the rights to a woman’s body.  No woman should be forced to birth a baby and put her own life at risk, have her rapists/abusers baby.  This is not a religious or government issue but a deeply personal choice for the woman."309,"I think we should legalize opiates like they did in Switzerland. I think addicts should be able to get administered by a health professional. And while that is going on they can get help for the underlying metal health issues and get of drugs that way. In Switzerland that have a very high success rate and it saves lives because it is all done under the care of a doctor.

Drugs like marijuana should be legal everywhere like that are in CA, MA and other states. It non-lethal and pretty safe to use. and it has some health benefits."311,Being able to use military money to help those unhoused and in need of equitable services will allow our society to become more balanced and compassionate. If we continue to see more force as t only answer to a cry for help we will only continue to degrade our society.312,"I think that abortion should be legal because women have a right to medical privacy and the procedure would still be performed illegally which would make it less safe. There need to be limits on the procedure, but at the end of the day the criminal Justice and foster care systems are overworked enough as it is without enforcing this ban."313,"I believe that illicit drugs should be legalized in the US. I hold this view because I feel like how substance use is handled in the US is abysmal. Instead of rehibilitating people from substances, we criminilaize people for drug use, especially black and brown Americans. By legalizing drugs in the US, we as a society change how we approach substance addiction and the ways we take care of each other. By legalizing drugs, we also allow for more oversite on substances that go out on the market. This could mean less drug overdoses due to unmentioned Fentanyl spikes in drugs or just due to overdosing in general."314,I support abortion because it is a woman's right to choose. A woman should not be forced to have a child that she does not want to take care of or is incapable of taking care of. Neither should she be punished for wanting to have sex.317,"I think the legalization of drugs is bad for the community; therefore, I oppose this. The legalization of drugs would cause a significant spike in drug use, victims, and drug addicts. This would cause our community to become even more dangerous than it already is."319,The issue of legalizing drugs is one i don't feel that strongly about because it is hard to imagine a best case scenario actually happening because it would likely be implemented poorly320,"I support defunding the police because I believe police officers don't prevent crime, they just respond to it. Studies have shown more investments to reduce poverty, investments in K-12 education, building jobs,  increasing wages, etc. will reduce crime. I think if some heavily policied cities in the US like NYPD, and DC Metropolitan Police Department would benefit from more money being invested in social services, social workers, and K-12 education. I also think that as long as this country doesn't do anything regarding gun control and reducing gun violence, violent and nonviolent crime will always be present."325,"I feel like I should choose affirmative action because I couldn't think of just small points. The idea behind it is that it helps put minorities and people who have been enslaved back on a better footing to succeed in society. That is a HUGE pro and should be the end of the discussion. But on the other side there are many cons. People taking advantage of the system, unfair treatment for those who do not qualify ect. While I understand these are real issues that can happen the good of affirmative action far outweighs the bad."327,"I believe vaccines should be mandatory unless at least doctors agree that it would harm the individual to be vaccinated.   We live in a society where diseases spread quickly and globally, vaccines offer the best bet of protection for everyone.   The risks associated with vaccines are very small, but the risks of a highly unvaccinated population are huge.   Small children and some with significant medical conditions can’t be vaccinated and it would be catastrophic if they caught certain diseases, we have a moral obligation to do what we can to protect them.  Some diseases will also evolve and become more dangerous if we don’t vaccinate against them now.  Our healthcare system is also crumbling in a lot of ways, we don’t need the additional burden that unvaccinated individuals will put on the system."328,"Making abortion illegal is a step backwards for any country that makes it so.
It takes away basic autonomy from patients about making healthcare decisions and family planning decisions. It is a gross abuse of power and is not rooted in science while dismissing half the population as being less than the other. It's an archaic view and insulting and dangerous."329,"Women do not need anyone to interfere with what they do with their bodies, even when pregnant. For one, if women had better, safer, and effective forms of birth control, they would not have to make these types of decisions to begin with. Although there are more available birth control methods, than from previous years, they are not necessarily safe for women to use. Abortion is a personal issue that must be left up to a woman to decided to do or not to do."331,I understand people being for vaccine mandates but the government has no right to tell you to take something that you do not want.332,"I have never been in trouble with the law, but I have never really liked or trusted them either. This, in spite of knowing some law enforcement officers well. I kind of understand why some people would say that we should defund the police. If you look at all of the horrible things they have done, it sort of makes sense.

However, what do you do once they're defunded? The United States, as it is now, wouldn't hold together without the military and police to enforce the will of the powerful on the rest of us. Law and order is how they sell it to us. At the end of the day, it is about control. So if we were to defund the police, who would be the most likely to replace them?

Common sense says it would be the military. In many places police are already being militarized. The end result here is fairly predictable... Before too long, people would be wishing they still had the local cops around. The way I see it, this comes down to a choice between two evils, and in this case I really believe the police are the lesser of the two."334,I don't believe all drugs should be legalized. There is an opioid epidemic in the midwest at the moment and kids are being exposed to drugs at younger ages. Tax payer money is being used to resuscitate overdoses with a medicine such as Narcan. Microdosing may help those with mental health issues and overall quality of life. But these drugs can be addictive and have been proven to be addictive.335,I hold the view that abortion should be legal because it is healthcare. Safe healthcare should be more of a right for all American citizens and eliminating a woman's right to choose is a giant step backward because it takes away a right that has been in place for decades and is government overreach. Abortion is a safe medical procedure when it is legal but becomes unsafe when made illegal.338,"I think mandatory vaccinations are a very important part of a civilized society. I think it prevents a few people from making many sick and it helps with the health system as a whole. I think without them it is virtually impossible to rid the world of certain diseases,"339,"I am in favor of keeping standardized tests, because there should be a standard way to measure students' aptitude and ability. We should not be dumbing down our standards in the name of ""fairness"". As much as we like to say everyone is equal, everyone is clearly NOT of equal ability, talent and intelligence. Not to mention the hard work that it requires to study and prepare for learning and testing. Those who put in the effort and hard work to excel should be rewarded for their effort, and a higher test score validates that."340,"I think abortion should be legalized because the right to have an abortion allows women to safely access a medical resource that aligns with what they want to do with their body. If abortion is illegal, women are left to fend for themselves and find unsafe ways to carry out an abortion. Also, a women becoming pregnant does not always become in a safe and consensual way, for example: rape, incest, etc. that has already stripped the woman from her autonomy. It should be the women's choice to do what she wants with her body and to be able to access the necessary resource for her morals and belief and as her right."341,"I believe abortion should be legal. It is and should be a woman's choice, it is her body and her life. Woman shouldn't be forced to have a baby. Some women are raped and become pregnant. Some children are being forced to give birth. It can be fatal for a woman to give birth sometimes."343,"I am for vaccine mandates. I am particularly opinionated about this topic because I have witnessed family members fall victim to conspiracy theories regarding a ""link"" between autism and vaccines and how this single idea leads them down the conspiracy rabbit hole. I don't know how to convince them that big pharma isn't out to get them and the government and Bill Gates isn't trying to reduce the population through vaccines but the minute they begin tuning into The Highwire by Del Bigtree I'm not sure there's a way to save their mind. I think letting people over the age of 40 have access to youtube unsupervised is the worst mistake we've made as a society."344,I oppose defunding the police because it will only allow more criminals to get away with their crimes due to the lack of police funds. It will leave more victims without justice and society would become more lawless.345,"I think mandatory vaccine mandates are needed because they help save lives and also the lives of our future generations as well from not getting sick. We have eradicated smallpox, which was a very dangerous disease, and it would help humans a lot if we could eradicate more of these dangerous diseases. Vaccines are also moderated well by our government agencies before being released to the public, so they are not harmful to humans."348,"Defunding the police would do more harm than good. While they do have too much power at times and do unjustly use their power, they still save and help many. By defunding them, it would make helping others much harder."349,"Affirmative action is only needed because of the unfairness and  abusiveness to particular groups based on their gender, race, sexuality, creed or nationality in areas in which they are underrepresented, such as education and employment. Fair is fair."351,"Removing the standardized test is probably the biggest issue for me. The nation is low and dropping rapidly in education and just having friends abroad, or even interacting globally on a casual scale, is enough to realize that America is more and more broadly considered the butt of the joke. Our in-place systems are failing, both us and in general, and there is only one greater problem (instructor pay) than the standardized test which encapsulates everything wrong.

By forcing students through an ever increasing list of requirements that they MUST know, teachers are often forced to speed through topics in as rote and dry manner as possible just to touch on all of the details. It prevents more engaged approaches towards fields that would benefit immensely from unorthodox/non-standard teaching methods such as the STEM fields, where many people simply do not interpret what they are learning in a way that feels approachable or engaging.

Further more, as the test continues to grow, undue pressure is placed on the students to retain information shown to them in sparser and sparser spans of time. It's doing no one any favors, either as student or teacher, and beyond that, we have continuing evidence that churning out raw test numbers has often only served to cultivate test-taking as a skill set, rather than cultivation of the subject matter itself."352,"Abortion should be legal to a certain point because a woman has the right to choose if they want to give birth. Should be legal at all stages for rape, incest, and birth complications."353,"While I’m not truly in favor of decriminalizing all drugs it’s obvious that the war on drugs is not working. I do think by decriminalizing it will will help with crime as there will be no need for dealers and also I feel there will be a reduction in the amount of drugs altered with substances like fentanyl.

Would the legalized drugs be dispensed medically or like alcohol?  How would it be monitored? How would addiction be handled?  

How are recreational drugs and alcohol a benefit for anyone?. I have only seen it ruin lives."355,"Abortion is a issue of controversy because humanity wants to make this issue as something necessary for our current society, which is not in depth is that through this action we are killing future human beings and is morally mislead of the world population, although in some cases it can be necessary to save the life of the mother that this and danger of death due to pregnancy problems."356,"Drug policy needs to be reshaped to be more focused on harm reduction rather than a ""war on drugs"" or otherwise an outright ban. As much as I want to see less drug use, making drugs illegal doesn't work, and has many other negative knock-on effects, such as giving a monopoly on drug sales to criminal organizations, who obviously pay no taxes on top of all the other problems they cause. There are many drugs that are less harmful, or even beneficial, compared to a common legal drug, alcohol. So while I support decriminalization of drugs and allowance for use in medical research, overall I would like to see policies that reduce the negative impacts of drug use overall, preferring treatment over expensive mass incarceration."358,"I believe abortion should be legal, and should perhaps even be expanded in many cases, for many reasons. As I detailed earlier, I believe forcing women to undergo that experience, or perhaps worse, utilizing unsafe means to circumvent it, does not serve to benefit society in any way. Making abortion harder to access results in more children being born to parents that typically do not have the means or desire to be parents, creating a vicious cycle of neglected children growing up in difficult situations to only to repeat it and very rarely being able to break out of that cycle. It makes society a worse place with no tangible benefit towards that society, only the esoteric one of preserving a human life, if you even believe that."359,Vaccines.  I think everyone needs to do their own research and do what is best for them and their kids.  I don't think anyone should make anyone get a vaccine360,"I think abortion should be illegal because it is the taking of the life of a human. That's called murder. Once a heartbeat begins, we should be caring for the baby and the mother carrying it. They both should have rights in the eyes of the law and medicine. Of course there will be difficult instances, involving rape or medical issues, and those should be guided by psychiatrists and doctors. If a pregnancy is going to kill or severely harm the mother, then maybe the gentle, loving thing to do is end that life. But we need to stop the rampant killing of inconvenient babies. 

So many abortions are had by people in committed relationships. Moms who already have a kid or two, know how demanding they can be, and chose to continue to have sex and just abort the little sibling. So many people view abortion as just another form of birth control. It's not. The ease of having an abortion shouldn't allow people to feel ok with unprotected sex. 

All people are image-bearers of God, our creator. All people should be protected and cared for, fed and educated and supported by each other. Abortion isn't the one issue with society. It is one of many, and the solution is going to involve many changes."362,"I think standardized test should be done away with as a benchmark for performance. The ACT and SAT are only able to predict success within the first year of college but those scores can be very limiting to people who did not score well on them. For example, prospective teachers who did not score a 21on the ACT in TN were required to pass the Praxis 1 series of test. This is really just a money grab from the testing companies."363,"Abortion is a disgusting process, in my opinion, and I would not be able to perform one myself. As a man, I don't have to worry about ever having an abortion. But I have a lot of sympathy for young women who get pregnant, and don't want to devote the next 18 years plus to a child that they don't want. Having a child changes everything for a woman. It costs a ton of money, and requires a lot of time and energy. I am willing to turn my head away from the gruesome act of abortion, if abortion helps society function better."365,My position on abortion is pretty neutral. I think they should have the right to get an abortion because this is a free country after all. But should be if they have gotten pregnant not because of their decisions but an event they had no control over. I feel though each state should decide their own laws on it and people who'd like to get one just live in the states that allow it. So at the end I'm not really against or for it but to each their own.368,"I believe some, if not all, drugs should be legalized. Legalizing drugs would provide opportunity to regulate drugs. This also brings opportunities to use the profits made legally selling drugs to be used to help the community like the education lottery does with lottery tickets. Providing drugs legally insures a safer supply of drugs that have not been cut or laced with anything reducing drug related deaths. This will also reduce street crime and put dangerous drug dealers out of business."369,I hold the opinion that drugs should not be legalized and readily available. I think there is not enough information on the long term effect of having accessible drugs available to anyone who is not a minor. I think in communities where marijuana is legal you can walk down the street and see many more high people ...I wonder what it is doing to their mental health. I would want to know studies about drug use and mental health . The last thing the USA needs is more mental health problems. We are already a country that does not give its people the care they need from doctors medically. What about addiction...does addiction increase with access? All in all I feel making drugs legal is a wrong move.370,"Vaccine mandates should be banned. They infringe upon personal freedom. Most people will willingly take vaccines that have proven to prevent diseases. Any people who choose not to be vaccinated will only hurt themselves since the entire purpose of vaccines is to make people immune to pathogens. So,  arguing a vaccine that doesn't work like covid ones should be mandated is absolutely insane."371,"The mandatory COVID-19 vaccines are extremely critical to getting rid of COVID once and for all. The people that refuse, or spread lies about imaginary side effects, are only making matters worse. This virus can be eradicated, just like Polio or measles or mumps, but the majority of the US population must be vaccinated. This is no different than the vaccines I got as a kid. I still have the pinpoint scar on my upper left bicep, just like most people. I’ve had every dose of the fact, including all boosters, and I’ve never had so much as a sore arm or a headache from any of them. The COVID vaccines must be mandatory. It’s the only way we get rid of this plague once and for all."375,"I am opposed to defunding the police. The supporters of this ""movement"" are never the people who would be most affected by taking cops off the streets: Low-income inner city residents and communities of color. Both of those groups are strongly in favor of police presence (check the actual poll data) because they see first hand what lax policies on crime do to neighborhoods. The rich, white suburban mom types who support defunding the police do it so that they can appear morally superior to the rest of us. They live in neighborhoods where they don't have to worry about gang violence, drugs, etc., so there is no actual cost for them to take such a politically ridiculous stance. I am very tired of ""wine mom"" activist politics that hurt everybody except for the upper classes. Defunding the police is Exhibit A of this morally and pragmatically bankrupt approach."376,"I object to vaccine mandates.  If an individual can be said to own anything indisputably, it is the physical matter of his own body.  Another may not violate, or invade such property against the will of its rightful sovereign, its self-emergent consiousness.  The penetration of another's flesh with a puncturing device against their will is itself a transgression of this principle.  The addition of a subsequent introduction of an advanced biotic technological contrivance exacerbates the magnitude of this transgression."378,"Abortion/reproductive rights should not only be legal but accessible. Having a baby is an incredibly important decision that has life-changing consequences, and no one should be forced to bear the weight and responsibly of having and raising a child they are not ready for, or that they don't want. Having to carry and give birth to a baby you do not want is traumatic, both physically and emotionally, and that trauma can easily continue if you do not have the capacity to provide for a human being for the next 18+ years of your life. Forced birth funnels and keeps low-income people in poverty, preventing them from achieving economic mobility, and reaching their personal goals."380,"The war on drugs is a waste of taxpayer's money. The Cartels ain't going anywhere, so the government might as well legalize the use of illicit drugs and monetize the market."382,Affirmative action is well-intentioned but morally wrong. It is still discrimination based on race or gender.383,"I strongly believe in vaccine mandates. It's quite clear from the COVID-19 pandemic that the public cannot be trusted to protect themselves or their community. Similar to abortion, a violation of bodily autonomy can be justified when the state has a compelling interest, which in both cases the state has viz public health and the preservation of human life. Even the risk of health effects is no barrier here, as it is, as I recall, settled law that fines for vaccine refusal due to medical risk are allowed.
I support both requiring businesses to vaccinate their workforce, but also fines for the unvaccinated, and potentially jailtime for egregious offenders or inciters such as Stew Peters. While 1A exemptions might exist, the vast majority would not be valid, as few religions prohibit vaccination even when aborted fetal cell lines are used. 

Doing this would, coupled with maintaining the high standards at the FDA and CDC, eliminate preventable by vaccination disease and death in our country while ensuring Adverse Events remain low."384,"I do not support the legalization of drugs that are harmful in nature. It would allow easier access to harmful substances. This would mean more people among our population are likely to turn to drug use because it is easy to acquire them as non-prescribed drugs. Proper legalization would facilitate increasing rates of drug usage, and likely increased rates of substance abuse."385,"I feel that abortion should be legal nationwide, with as few restrictions as possible.  People should have access to medical care which could save their lives and could prevent them from being negatively affected economically.  It will also help with overpopulation and prevent further strain on an already taxed foster/adoption system."387,I believe abortion should be legal with the amount of unwanted and non-consensual pregnancies that lead to the children being abused and neglected in the United States rising. The fact that rape victims are forced to389,"I support removing standardized testing. It puts a lot of pressure on students to teach children how to pass the test. It leaves less time to actually study the core items. Kids are actually learning less. Also, standardized test puts pressure on children to pass the test. It causes some kids to become anxious. Standardized testing does not really show how much a child is learning because some kids struggle with taking test. Also, standardized testing is unfair. Schools with more money have the resources to give their students a better chance to pass the test."390,"I think affirmative action is wrong because people should not get special benefits because of their race or gender. They should be in a position because they have what it takes. It would be better for us to address certain cultural or social problems that prevent minorities from getting into positions of power and prestige, and help them get on a level playing field, rather than put them in positions based on their minority status."392,"I support the right to abortion because there are many kinds of risks to mother's health, and many reasons why a woman may not want to have a child, such as rape, incest, health issues, or financial reasons."394,"I definitely oppose , defending the police, it would promote higher crime, and make us all unsafe. Police already has limited budgets, and put their lives on the line everyday, defunding will have officers leaving for better jobs. We need policeman for a variety of different reasons, and just because there are a few bad apples,  you don't discount the good ones, you would be better off investing more funds to give them better training."399,"My position on abortion is pro-choice. I believe everyone should have the right to decisions regarding their own bodies. People with a uterus cannot always control when they get pregnant, nor should they be forced to carry a baby if they financially or emotionally cannot provide for a child simply because they chose to have sex. People should not be shamed or punished for choosing to have sex as consenting adults. I also believe people with a uterus should have the ability to decide to abort a pregnancy if the pregnancy poses severe risk of harm to themselves or the fetus."400,"Abortion should be a matter that is handled by people who have a uterus, if you don't have a uterus your view is irrelevant. Abortion can save the lives of already living babies and the lives of women (and those with uteruses) that should be seen as just as if not more important"403,"I agree strongly with defunding the police, because the police are basically a militarized gang with the ability to intimidate and kill, with near-total protection because of their involvement with the legal system. Police brutality is almost impossible to get punished for, as is domestic violence, which occurs at a higher rate among police officers compared to the general population."404,I believe that abortion should be completely legal.  People who are able to reproduce children should not be forced to give birth just because someone else thinks it's morally wrong.  There is no good reason that people shouldn't have freedom of choice in this matter.  Noone should impose their beliefs on what someone does with their own body.405,"I strongly believe abortion should be legalized everywhere. We should not be forcing women to give birth, ever. Especially if it's a medical issue, or if she's a minor. I will always believe women should have a choice."408,"I think affirmative action should not be repealed because affirmative action is in relation to the imperialist, racist system that has historically denied people of color access to opportunities in the the United States. Affirmative action isn't racism as its opponents argue, but rather combatting hundreds of years of racism. There are many factors that impact why people of color may or may not have lower standardized scores or grades than white people. Many of the reasons relate back to racism and the impacts of which that set people of color at a disadvantage."409,"I feel that abortion should be made legal. For many pregnant women, complications can arise that would require abortion or else the mother can die (i.e. ectopic pregnancy). Some women do not have the means to raise a child and only forcing them to bring the child to term can be detrimental for that child's future because they do not have the support they need to thrive. The child may be put in the foster care system, where abuse can happen. If they age out, they may  become homeless and may fall to drug use. Forcing women to carry a child that was due to rape or sexual assault is extremely harmful to their mental health."410,"The issue that I choose is abortion. I strongly support abortion rights because, as a woman, I believe I am entitled to my body and what I do with it. no one else including the government should prevent me for getting a medical procedure if that is my wish. abortion should be legal terminate an unwanted pregnancy whether that be because it was unplanned, or it was a result of rape. living in a state that complete prohibits any sort of abortion angers me because it is forcing hundreds of women (and children) to give birth when they might not have the economic resources or mental capacity to take care of a child."412,"Banning abortion is barbaric to women, based on faulty science, and wouldn't even work. Every time a ban is tried. abortions don't even go down. It fails its own litmus test. Fetuses aren't even awake and they are distinct from babies medically and according to science. Whenever a ban is tried, women die. This is the only real effect it has. So, if you want to keep living in a free country that isn't ruled by religion and is ruled by reason, and further you would prefer that women won't die for no reason, you will oppose bans."419,"I strongly believe that abortion should be legal and safe for all women at any point during pregnancy everywhere in the United States. Besides the principle that outlawing abortion is sexist and denies women  the choice to make decisions about their own lives and bodies, there are many critical cases in which abortion access is necessary for women's health, safety, and livelihood. Many women face health problems during pregnancy for which they need to have an abortion, so outlawing abortion can lead to the death or extreme illness of those women. Additionally, children and rape victims need access to abortion so that they do not have to experience the trauma of carrying a child to term. Additionally, people should be able to choose to have an abortion if they do not want to experience pregnancy, since pregnancy is incredibly uncomfortable and permanently alters the body."421,The police department should be defunded because those funds could be easily used to benefit society better in other places. Defunding the police the police will help to decrease the violence police present over people of color. Defunding also allows experts to step into some of the responsibilities that cops would normally have that they aren't directly trained for.433,Abortion because it being illegal will cost many lives unnecessarily.435,"I support affirmative action because I was given the opportunity to attend elite institutions as a disadvantaged student. I didn't do well, but I learned a lot about the world outside of where I lived, where barely any white people live. I have heard opponents to affirmative action go on about how disadvantaged students, namely black students, don't do well at these schools but this sort of reminds me of the government interfering with Abortion. Like medical issues, education records are a matter of confidentiality. I have learned in the time since I failed out of my first college that I needed a lot of mental health help. I think that along with affirmative action, there should be programs that help support students with things like mental health, where people give them a direction and maybe even require them to take classes on things like abnormal psychology. Removing black kids' ability to go to schools isn't only about them being successful in ""lower ranked schools"" because all black students would be held behind as far as networking opportunities are concerned."436,Vaccines should be mandatory because of the fact that diseases that were once almost completely gone because of vaccines are reappearing. If we have a safe vaccine for the public then it should be a citizens duty to protect themselves and the public.439,I strongly believe that reproductive choice and access to abortions must be protected. It is about bodily autonomy and not having the state infringe on complicated and personal medical decisions. Banning abortion has already caused many cases of lives being put at risk. We cannot go back in time and allow for this state sanctioned violence to proliferate and exert control over basic freedoms to choices towards ones own body.440,the last thing this planet needs is more people. Births must be limited to one half per adult or we all go extinct442,"I believe that the police should be defunded as long as the government is willing to bring up another agency which is more qualified to deal with situations like mental health crisis. I think this would lead to less police brutality, and possibly an organization which isn’t so systemically flawed"443,"Dissolving Affirmative Action would allow a backsliding into unfair practices. However, Affirmative Action plans need to be monitored and adjusted regularly to ensure they are effectively meeting their objectives for the target population."445,"I don't think vaccines should be mandatory. I think it's good if as many people get them as possible, but it should not be required. People have many reasons for not wanting them, including fears of the unknown, possible complications, allergies to ingredients, religious reasons, etc. Some are based on misinformation, but people should still have body autonomy, even for dumb reasons. Also, there are other ways to prevent spread, like masks and distancing"448,"Illicit drug use. I feel we have a drug epidemic in this country. People are dying. Harm reduction has time and time over been shown to help these things, giving a safe legal alternative and safe usage advice from trained counsel. I just do not feel drugs are going away any time soon and it is likely better to work with that than against it."452,"Vaccines:
My right to swing my arm ends where your face begins. If I refuse to get vaccines or vaccinate my child, I am not just putting myself at risk. I'm increasing the risk of transmission to others.. I'm also, potentially overburdening the health care system and putting people who need care at risk. If the hospitals are full, then people die of heart attacks. This isn't just about me."453,Abortion should be legal in all circumstances to ensure women are treated equally454,"Affirmative action is a good idea in theory. Racist hiring managers and businesses may not hire nonwhites if they aren't forced to. It has some potential problems depending on its implementation. For example, if done purely by skin color, it ignores disadvantages caused by economic class. A rich black person is better off than an impoverished white person, but solely race based affirmative action policies ignore this. It can also devolve into quotas which may fuel racism. If someone loses a job opportunity because the arbitrary quota of certain skin color has already been met or needs to be met, that may make them vulnerable to racist propaganda. It may also fail to address core problems. If drones are bombing innocent civilians in a war, having more of those drones piloted by minorities doesn't solve the problem, but it allows for propaganda about reducing racial inequality amongst drone pilots to overshadow the war crimes those drone pilots are committing."455,-457,Drugs could be legalized. It would reduce the prison population and create innovation in therapeutic treatments for various illnesses. Marijuana legalization has been relatively innocuous and the same pattern could be extended to other substances.458,"I think that vaccine mandates should be put in place by the government. While I understand the concerns that some people have about such mandates, I think it is such a benefit when it comes to public health. There are already enough hardships in life without diseases that can be easily combated. The resurgence of some older diseases is concerning to me as well."459,Defund the police. It doesn’t work as a system. They are racist. They murder people. I’m terrified of them. They do no good in the community.460,"I strongly support abortion rights, for a few reasons. The first being that a woman's right to choose should always be protected, and violent sexual crimes against women can carry lifelong consequences and reminders of said event. Republicans who vote against abortion rights, mostly men who would never have to experience this personally, discuss the ""sanctity of life"" while also voting to do nothing to help children. Most of this comes from Republicans' religious backgrounds who say abortion is wrong, which shouldn't happen in the first place because the separation of church and state is in the constitution.

There are cases where it is factually, medically necessary. Even a planned, wanted child could encounter problems which may threaten the lives of both said baby and their mother, in which abortion would quite literally save the woman's life. In addition to this, banning abortion would NOT end abortion, it would only stop SAFE abortion. There are millions of unsafe abortions performed yearly, and this number would greatly increase should a nationwide ban on abortion occur."462,"I think the war on drugs needs to end.  It is a losing battle and the people arrested are caught in the legal system.  This keeps the prisons running and people employed.
Once you get arrested for drug use you are at the mercy of the judges and courts. Then you have a record, which makes it harder to get employed.
Making it legal should also come with the addition of many more treatment facilities, which could be funded by the money saved from keeping people out of jail
It seems as though alcohol is also really bad and negative for many, yet that is legal, and the government makes a lot of money from taxing alcohol.
Also making drugs legal will take away some of the glamour and excitement young people have for doing something illegal."465,I think weed should be legalized because other states it’s free to do so. Also weed should be legalized because it is not a drug. Weed doesn’t harm anyone. It doesn’t make you do crazy stuff like alcohol.467,"It only makes sense for vaccination to be mandatory, regardless of what point of view we take. Almost everyone has family who are vulnerable, if they are not vulnerable themselves. Selfish interest of simply protecting your family members should lead you to wanting strangers to be vaccinated. Even without that, all of us rely on the healthcare system to protect us during our worst moments. Hospitals and emergency rooms being flooded by a preventable disease puts all of us in danger, as we are very likely to get less effective care as a direct result when we need to use those services. Longer waits, less beds, increased odds of infection etc. For these reasons you should support mandatory vaccination."468,"I don't support the far right's current drive to criminalize abortion, for several reasons. First, there's a strong moral case to make that reproductive rights are just as important to protect as economic and social rights -- because there's no way to separate them from one another, especially when a woman is faced with a pregnancy that she didn't expect, yet lacks the means to support. I don't believe that 70-year-old right wing males should be making those decisions for them.

Second, I've never been satisfied with the far right's demands for women to carry babies to term, regardless of the consequences -- they always seem to vanish as soon as the baby appears. They make their case even more complicated -- or hypocritical, depending on how charitable you feel -- by lobbying against birth control and prenatal care, two related measures that one assumes would go a long way toward making abortion ""safe, rare and legal.""

Third, I believe that most efforts to criminalize abortion reflect a desire for power and control over the rest of us at any cost, yet such efforts -- as Prohibition, and the so-called War on Drugs, to name two -- have never succeeded in ensuring 100% control over a population that overwhelmingly supports the idea of legalized abortion, with some controls over how and why it should be done. Social resistance would spring up against a federal ban, just as it did against the banning of alcohol in the 1920s, or the attempts to lock down illegal consumption of controlled substances.

Fourth, even if you could completely control abortion through draconian limits, and penalties against doctors for performing it, what's to say the far right's goals would stop there? We saw a glimpse of this last summer, when Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas suggested going contraception and gay marriage. Even if  abortion could be completely and efficiently criminalized, I doubt most of us would want to live in such a society.

Fifth, there are cases where abortion is"472,"Defunding the police is a simplistic, knee-jerk response to a very complex issue. Police have been trained a certain way that leads to excessive restraint and shooting to kill as the only tools at their disposal. Instead the police need the same or more funding to examine the issues they face in a more intelligent, balanced, and nuanced way. Perhaps a psychology based unit should be set up to analyze and approach problems with a different set of tools that does not so quickly resort to violence. And, obviously, officers should undergo extensive training against any kind of bias against suspects due to race or religion. Officers should be screened psychologically to determine their states of mind and those with racial prejudice or violent tendencies should be fired."473,"(TW: mention of rape) I believe that abortion should be legal. People should be able to decide if they want to have children. Whether they knowingly have sex and knew they could become pregnant, or they were raped, they should have the choice of terminating the fetus. Aside from that, we already have so many kids without parents. We don’t need more. I also support a person’s choice to keep the fetus. Overall, choice is key."474,Pregnancy at its core a medical condition.  It should at such be entirely the decision of the pregnant woman whether she takes the pregnancy to term or not.475,"Affirmative action

I get the point of affirmative action, it is to give black people the opportunity to get into college in order to compensate for years of oppression and slavery. However, I think that doing so would create a system in which just by virtue of being from a particular group you would be granted with special rights over the rest of people, and I think that is just unfair."478,"Abortion should NOT be illegal. Women should decide what they want to do with their bodies. Their body, their choice."479,"I am a firm believer that all abortions should be legal.  Women should have complete and total autonomy over their body, and have the choice whether or not have a baby if they are pregnant.  I think that it is important for a number of reasons, including personal freedom, making sure options are available to ensure womens health, and giving latitude to individuals to make choices that are the best for themselves and their family.  I think that outlawing abortion would be a major blow to both individual freedom and to the ability of our healthcare system to adequately address the needs of women."481,"I'll choose to write about standardized testing, which I support keeping in academic admissions. Standardized tests are somewhat problematic in that they seem to positively correlate with being of a higher socioeconomic status and being White. The cost can also be exorbitantly high to take the tests and send score reports to relevant institutions. However, fee waivers do exist for students with demonstrated financial need. Further, this metric is objective and standardized across all test takers, which represents the opportunity to compare candidates on the same measure whereas something like GPA could be influenced by the quality of the school a candidate attends. Further, it could represent an opportunity for otherwise less competitive candidates to stand out. Perhaps a hybrid version whereby a standardized test score could only help, but not hurt, an applicant's chances would be preferable."482,"Defunding the police:
If a police force is found to be out of control then it might pay society to clip the wings of that force. We need to be objective and not defund all police. It's clear that our police are not being trained properly. So many of them just shoot when an alternative could have been used, although they wouldn't be much use if their guns had no bullets, from defunding. If I was getting attacked by a bear or a thug I would like to see a police officer shoot my attacker."484,"I support the right to an abortion, and I believe abortion should be legal and accessible for all. I hold that position because I believe that a pregnancy is part of a person's body, and it is that person's choice to carry that pregnancy or not. I believe anyone should be able to get an abortion for any reason. When abortion is made illegal, that does not mean people will stop getting abortions. It means that people will seek out unsafe methods to end their pregnancies, which will result in people dying. Making abortions illegal also causes complications for people who experience a miscarriage, as we have seen people be arrested for inducing an abortion when they were actually having a miscarriage. When someone is denied the right to make decisions about their own body, that is a serious problem."485,"Defunding the police had me very confused when I first heard the term.  Whomever came up with that term, and broadcast it, needs to be thunked on the head.  My first go to emotion was fear.  I was envisioning skeleton police crews in the midst of intense political and cultural upheaval.  Now, though, I have a better understanding of it.

I do believe that police and those who are being retained/arrested could benefit from a shifting around of police department funds.  Increase the length, and quality, of recruit training.  Right now, it is awful how easy it is to be given a gun, ammo, badge and car.  Portions of the money can be given to agencies that can assist with the mental and emotional health of citizens.  Beef up the agencies that help people with getting their lives to a point where committing a crime isn't their go-to choice.  So much more life to be live."491,"I think abortion should be legal because it will never be stopped. Having it legalized gives women a safe way to get an abortion, should they choose to do so. Some women only become pregnant due to rape, and would not like to have a child as a reminder of that. Some women would not be able to properly take care of their children. They should be allowed to have a safe choice over whether or not they want to become a parent since no one can place guarantees on contraceptives."492,"The issue I chose is defunding the police. It's something I support, but I believe it's misunderstood as the phrase 'defund the police' is misleading and results in people making false assumptions. Rather than taking away money from law enforcement, it actually brings in other members of the community - such as those trained in mental health - and lets them work with police on certain community matters. These are people trained in specific areas that can help police deescalate and prevent crime."493,"I feel most strongly about abortion so I will write about that.  

I was disgusted when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.  We have made so much progress with women's rights and equality since the 1970's and now we took a huge leap backwards.  

The court is saying that women should have no rights about what to do with their own bodies and the rest of their life.  The court is saying its OK for a women, including older children, to be raped, and then be forced to have the baby of their rapist. The court is saying its OK for a poor women to be forced to have a baby and then struggle financially to provide for it. The court is saying its OK for a single women to be forced to have a baby and then raise it without a father.

The court was wrong.  Women should have these rights.  I look forward to a day of a largely Democratic Supreme Court that will put things back to where they were for 50 years."494,"I believe that drug use should be legalized. Since the problem is that these people are suffering from addiction, and no other crime, then it makes no sense to lock them up for that issue. What can be done to kill drugs for good, or heavily reduce the dependency on them, is to legalize them, monitor their use, and work to get people rehabilitated.  That way, the problem is gone, and people don't have to suffer for their mistakes."495,I think police should be defunded because their funding is already the highest in the nation. This higher funding has not lead to less crime or police brutality. The police act as state sanctioned violence and more funding for them means that state violence becomes easier and more prominent.496,"I am in support of abortion.  I think that a woman should have say over what she does with her own body.  Banning abortion is very dangerous.  Many pregnancies do not go according to plan, and some require the baby to be aborted in order to save the mother's life.  Banning abortions doesn't allow women in that situation to seek help, and puts the mother's life at risk.  Additionally, women that are raped should not have to carry their rapist's baby.  Banning abortion will not actually stop abortions, it will just cause underprivileged women to have to seek them out illegally, which could often be dangerous.  The rich will still be able to fly to a place where abortion is legal to have theirs.  Banning them doesn't actually solve any problem at all, except making the religious feel that they ""saved babies"".  We should be channeling that effort instead on providing sex education to the masses, so that women are informed and able to have babies on their own terms -- and provide them with love and a good life.  That's actually how to ""save babies""."503,"I feel that standardized tests should be removed, unless a student wishes to do it. An example reason for me is thinking about kids who struggle through high school, not taking it so seriously and then do horribly on the tests. A few years after high school, they realize that they can do better with their life and want to go to college. However, due to lack of testing or low test scores, they can only go to community college. This is unfair."505,I think that abortions should be legal.  Women should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and future without the government being involved.507,"I am strongly pro-choice. Though I understand why some are vehemently opposed to abortion, they have no right to push their religious or ""moral' views on the rest of the population. And, the government certainly has no right to legislate morality. I like what Joe Lieberman said when he was Albert Gore's vice-presidential selection about abortion. He said something to the effect that as an orthodox Jew, he is against abortion, but he does not have the right to impose this belief on all Americans. I believe that while abortion should be a last resort, each woman much decide for herself what to do. It is their body and their life."508,The police should be defunded. But it should be done in thoughtful way. Studies would have to be done to make sure it's being done in a way that is fair and effective. It's needed as a broad reform of the entire criminal justice system. I've seen the way police treat all people and it's mostly very unfair. But that is nothing in comparison to how people of color are treated. And I don't want my tax money going toward that. I think it would break up their horrible so called union that has nothing to do with better salaries and working conditions like other labor unions.509,"Making abortions illegal, again, puts women's rights back fifty years.  The leaders of the push to criminalize abortion are almost  all old, white men.  No skin in the game.  The new fathers and the new mothers should have nearly equal responsible for the abortion decision and we can talk.  But ultimately, the decision impacts a women's rights to her own body."510,"I think we should not defund the police in the way defund the police groups are advocating The unfortunate reality of policing is that cops are often too quick to resort to violence while performing their duty, they can escalate situations that would have been resolved without them, and they have entrapped innocent people crimes they did not commit due to underlying biases or just gross negligence, however, police still play a vital role in our society despite these problems. A system of law enforcement is needed to counteract and discourage criminal behavior within society and a police force is needed to investigate and stop crime. Polling shows that minority communities, the same communities that are at an increased risk of being mistreated by law enforcement, are not in favor of defunding the police. Police are asked to do the jobs of social workers without the training that social workers get and this needs to be addressed, however, defunding the police will not help these problems but rather create a whole host of new problems."511,"Abortion should be legal but somewhat regulated.  But I still think you're killing a baby.  Abortion used _simply_ as a means of birth control, I'm against; things like extenuating circumstances, health of the mom, potential hard life of child, etc, I am for abortion."512,"I am very strongly in favor of abortion being legal because criminalizing it disproportionately harms people who are already tossed aside by society. Criminalizing abortion harms victims of rape and sexual violence, especially children subjected to such, and can lead to serious harm or death of women forced to carry a fetus (even a non-viable fetus) to term. It limits women's access to other forms of healthcare that could potentially be construed as having the potential to abort a fetus. Criminalizing abortion is a way of forcing a certain subset of Christian moral views on everyone, including non-Christians, and as a result defies the supposed separation of church and state.
I hold this view because I have been educated on the topic and because I know many people who are harmed, disproportionately, as a result of abortion becoming illegal again in many states."513,"I listened and watched too many people refuse to believe in Covid-19 and refuse to be vaccinated. Paranoia about anything the government offers is nothing new, but even the most paranoid person has to admit no organization or government could ""stage"" so many deaths and so many hospital personnel warning everyone about the dangers.

I live in Kentucky, one of the most stubborn states about denying the vaccine, and it's frankly embarrassing. Just like believing Trump is a great man -- denial shows ignorance."518,"I'm ""old school"" and I grew up using standardized tests.  My children also were given standardized tests when then went to school.  That doesn't mean they should remain in place forever, but it certainly gave us a feel for how they were doing in relation to their classmates.  I understand that there is a wide variety between how different schools work.  There are differences in funding, quality of teachers, income levels of students, etc.  All of these factors, plus others, will impact how students fare.  Therefore, it makes sense to question the validity and meaningfulness of these tests.  Is it fair to hold students to the same standard tests when so much about their circumstances are different?  

This exercise shows me that I hold more questions than answers, and maybe I'm not so sure of where I stand, other than that I am used to living in a world with standardized testing as the norm."519,I think that in countries where drug usage is open and supposedly controlled there is a much higher rate of crime in that area. The health of those using drugs so easily goes down but healthcare costs go up. Even if the government could collect taxes on the sale of drugs the healthcare costs would far exceed the income. The damage to families and children of drug users can't even be totaled.520,"I strongly support the right to have an abortion. As a woman, it is absolutely terrifying to think that the government would be allowed to tell me what I can and cannot do with my body. It only starts at this one issue, when you take away bodily autonomy you take away womens rights in general. It's abhorrent in my opinion that this is even a question in our society today. Taking away a basic human right to decide whether or not I want to or should have a child means that the government would decide the future of millions of women. Millions of babies would be born and abandoned, the government would either have to fund those children's lives or figure out what to do with them. The entire issue was a half baked idea by men to try and control women."523,"Women die when abortion is not legal. There are dozens of reasons for a person to decide they can't bear a child to term at any point. From the ubiquitous ""rape and/or incest"" to it is just not what the person wants to do with their life at this time. And as a free person, no governmental representative has the right to make that decision. Most of those making these decisions barely have the anatomical understanding to know how a baby pops out, much less the right to hold another humans' rights in their hands to that degree. It is as simple as this...if you are against abortions, don't have one. But regulating something that is so dangerous anyway is horrifically wrong. And more women will die."527,"Abortion is an issue of individual rights and autonomy, health care,  and abortion being leagal does not infringe upon any individual’ religious freedoms. 

Th religious belief that life begins at conception or at some point soon after is not backed by science. Laws that make abortion illegal before a fetus is viable and able to survive outside the womb on its own are not based upon scientific evidence but rather are based upon religious beliefs. In order to be a free citizen individuals must have autonomy over their own bodies .

Persons with religious beliefs against abortion are free to not have abortions so their relious liberty is not being infringed upon when abortion is legal.

Abortion is a matter of health care for an individual free citizen. It is also a matter of allowing an individual to be free to plan ones life.  These rights should not be taken away based upon someone else’s religious beliefs."528,"I do not support legalization of drugs. In saying this, I mean all drugs. Certain drugs, such as pot, have been found to be helpful in certain health situations. That is OK. But, to legalize all drugs mean people can have easy access to drugs that destroy. It would lead to more crime and more people unable to work, leading to more homeless."530,"The issue on abortion is hard on me, I had an abortion at the age of 17. I was raped by my ex boyfriend. I tried to keep my baby, but the dr told me the baby would be born sick because of the dads drug use. At this point I could not hold anything I ate or drank down. At 22 weeks I had an abortion done. not only did I suffer physically but also mentally. I never forget my first baby. Everyday I wonder what she or he would be like. My experience at that clinic was the worst. Afterward I was left violently shaking and full of blood. Abortion should only be done if it is medically necessary"535,"My position on abortion is that I believe every woman and girl deserves a choice in whether to become a mother or not. Pregnancy and birth are hard on the body and can have life-long mental and physical effects, including death. Forcing women to have unwanted children hurts everyone and significantly contributes to increased crime, poverty and abuse. Pregnant women are also more likely to die by homicide as well. Regardless of your personal beliefs, nothing and no one has the right to your body whether you consider it alive or not."537,"I am against vaccine mandates because they restrict personal liberty and they have a tendency to undermine the perceived effectiveness of the mandated vaccines.  Regardless of the potential public good, it is not appropriate for authorities to force people to consume something.  Further, by making a vaccine mandatory, it suggests that the vaccine is either more dangerous  or less effective than the authorities state. If something is so safe and so effective, why would someone have to be forced into using it?"538,"I feel that affirmative action is one of the most detrimental programs that has been developed. Many people try to explain how such programs foster diversity and increase the chances of minorities. That is not the job of government or educational entities. When looking at an individual they should be judged on their abilities, likelihood of success, and chances of completing a program. The color of the person or their racial background should not be an issue. If individuals are judged purely by the color of their skin then the program is by definition racist and discriminates against other groups. The simplest solution is to judge people based on their skills, and disregard any factors pertaining to their background."539,Abortion is a medical decision between a women and their doctor.  There's lots of reasons why an abortion might need to take place and none of them are my business or the business of my senator.540,"Defunding the police -- it's the one of the most fool hearty things I've ever heard of. And people are too stupid to realize this until they're in an emergency situation and there are no police to call. When there is crime happening, especially to your person, you're gonna want the police involved. Even though there are some real bad apples in there, we need the police in strong force to uphold the law and protect citizens and society in general. The good definitely outweighs the bad when it comes to the police force."542,"I feel strongly that illicit drugs should not be legalized. I feel that legalization of these drugs will cause more chaos than good. If people have easy access to these drugs, there is a higher chance that more people will become addicted. If this happens then the government is going to feel even more obligated to spend more money on drug treatment programs. It is not fair to taxpayers that do not use drugs to have to pay for programs for those that do."546,"Abortion is the continued barbaric practice of human sacrifice for the leisure of the living. There is zero good arguments for the legalized murder we call abortion. The small outliers constantly cited (rape, incest, ""health of the mother"") are less than 2 percent of overall abortions. 98% are done for convenience because the culture we live in has treated children as an obstacle to freedom, not the point of existing.

Life begins at conception. To throw one's hands up in a fit and say ""we don't know when life begins"" only validates banning abortion all the more. If we are UNSURE of when life begins, it makes no sense to regulate it other than when we know the pregnancy begins. You are taking a stab in the dark at killing another human being."547,I am morally against legalized drugs. I use to live in WA and watched pot farms go up all over the place. The pot farms smelled terrible and everywhere I went I could smell people smoking pot. My neighbor smoked it and his smoke always drifted into my back yard. I believe pot is a gateway drug and is more harmful than cigarettes to the body. Kids found it easier to get their hands on as it was ubiquitous. People became even more lazy then they already were. During business hours in town I saw numerous male men go into pot shops and then to a game stop. Shameful. I can't even imagine what this country would be like with more dangerous drugs legalized.549,"Human life begins at conception, when an egg is fertilized by sperm, this new life, which has its own DNA, is separate from its mother. I believe killing a human is wrong therefore, I believe that abortion is wrong because it involves the taking of a human life. This is not to be flippant or reductionary to a woman's experience, or that her life does not matter. But when a woman becomes pregnant, I believe in most cases, it is wrong to recieve an abortion and abortions should be illegal."550,"I am adamantly against abortion because I am convinced life starts at the moment an egg is fertilized. A woman who has consensual sex knows the risks and has effectively made her choice at the point of having sex, so cannot use the ""it's my body"" excuse.  Only women who were raped, or who may have permanent medical harm or death from a pregnancy should have a right to abortion. (I consider incest a form of rape.)  It is only in this case that the ""my body, my choice"" mantra makes any sense whatsoever.

I also believe that minorities disproportionately have more abortions and that is actually by design, if you look at the history of abortion advocacy. This is disgusting.

There are more effective, more moral contraception strategies, and they should be taught to all children, starting with abstinence until marriage, but including condom use, and so on, but people should be taught that they are making a choice if they have voluntary sex, and they should not be allowed to escape that moral choice."551,Defunding the police may actually be the most stupid thing I have ever heard of. Who in their right mind could even look at this issue logically and think that any good could come from this. Crime WILL increase and more to the point violent crime. When we the people need support from law inforcement and they cant respond because or this we will all suffer. Even the people that want to defund the police.552,"Defunding the police:
I do not support defunding the police because I think crime rates will go up. I will also feel less safe in my cities if there are fewer police. Police also help respond to emergencies such as medical or fire emergencies. As with every occupation, there are a few bad apples, however, that should not define the whole police force. Overall, they do much more good than bad. They give themselves to their community and will help anyone, even the people they know do not support them."554,I support mandatory vaccination to prevent the spread of a deadly disease.  I am appalled that some of the medical community are against when it is for their own protection and the safety of their patients.  Too many people did not take the pandemic serious enough and refused to be masked and vaccinated which contributed to the disease taking innocent lives.  I chose to be vaccinated because I chose to live.562,I do not want our culture to encourage the murder of innocent children. I would like to see more support put in place for women who are pregnant and need help to either keep her child or give the child to people who can care for it.563,With affermitive action I belive all people should be treated equal. People make choices in their lives starting in early childhood. If parents don't raise their kids to do their best and try and learn why should other people have less a chance in life. I live in an area that's almost equal black and while people. It's really nice expensive part of town to live in. All these people made it without affermative action blacks and whites both. I think others should do the same.564,"I have found that affirmative action has been misused. For example, I have seen unqualified minority individuals hired when they were clearly unqualified. Affirmative action has been abused when minorities receive special treatment rather than equal treatment. Affirmative action is beneficial when racism exists in an organization when the majority thinks only individuals who are white should be hired."567,Standardized tests are not a reflection of academic knowledge. They are used to trick and manipulate students. High school students taking these tests are already under an extreme amount of stress trying to plan their futures. These tests only contribute to their stress and truly are no reflection of good or bad academics.569,I am 100% for college aptitude tests. Poor students that score high can go to college where without these tests they won't even be looked at by the college administrators. High scores on these test correlate very highly with success in college.571,I oppose vaccines being mandated. I believe that medical decisions are a personal choice and mandating a choice upon others is wrong. I think that Government and Pharma companies rarely if ever have the citizens best interest in mind. Everything should be a choice not a mandate.574,"Legalized drugs

My son died of a drug overdose because the pill he took was laced with fentanyl. Hopefully this could be prevented if drugs were regulated and dispensed like cannabis. There will always be people who want to take drugs so let’s legalize, regulate, and control the dispensing of them."576,"I would not recommend drugs being legalized. That sends the wrong message to the user, seller and potential user - young people. This suggests that it is okay to use drugs. We all know better. It's not okay. It's harmful to your body and causes a lot of conflict in home, work and families. There is a lot of money wasted in the drug industry that could be supporting children and families."578,"Affirmative Action - I do not believe in this because it automatically favors one group over the other creating reverse discrimination. Some companies have to fill an internal and unspoken quota, which means giving people jobs because they are a particular race."585,"In the case of abortion, I believe there should be an option to get an abortion up until 3 months or if the mothers life is at risk or they have gotten raped or incest has occurred. It should not be this hard. There is plenty of time in between those three months to spot signs of pregnancy and plenty of time for the mother to decide if they want to have a baby or not. Obviously if they were raped or incest has happened or their life is in danger they should get aborted, zero questions asked. By three months however, the baby is starting to look and be an actual human. At this point you are just killing a person."587,"I believe affirmative action causes more harm than good. It is unfair to accept a minority student with similar or lesser qualifications over a white student into a program. Moreover, the minority student may be treated as if they were admitted due to affirmative action as opposed to merit."588,"Vaccination, I think it’s a positive thing that can help you and others stay healthy. Yet, it’s difficult to say it’s ok to mandate that on other people."590,I agree with defunding the police. Many hard earn tax payer money is going to the police for what? I don't mean fully defund the policce but their budget needs to get cut and that money can be fund other important things that need attention. Police harassment have far been out of control. And most of the brutality and misconduct are behind close doors so the public are not fully aware of the unacceptable behaviors they commit towards citizens.593,"I have the opinion that the police should not be defunded.  I hold this view because I believe without the proper police presence, lawlessness will become worse than it currently is.  I believe that the police keep our society safe and people freer from harm.  I believe that if police were defunded, then our society would be a much more dangerous place."595,"I believe that legalizing drugs beyond schedule 3 will allow more easily accessible help to those who are In need. Providing more funding toward the programs that help, easily identify addicts without recourse of action and ultimately lower crime based on how need those individuals will be."596,"The abortion debate ultimate comes down to a determination of if you believe that the unborn baby is entitled to moral consideration or not. I believe that life begins at conception. Thus, abortion is immoral because it is tantamount of killing a living being."598,"I'm strongly against mandatory vaccines specifically the Covid-19 vaccines.  To start with I don't believe they are either safe or effective.  Whatever limited benefit they may offer to some people only lasts for a few months before you have to go back in and get a booster.   If you you want to get dangerous Covid booster shots every four to five months feel free but leave me out of it.  I also want to point out that every thing we were told about this Covid vaccine has turned out to be a lie, remember all the T.V. pundits who told you that the virus stops with every vaccinated person? Wrong they were just kidding, it was a joke, or it was a lie, or maybe they didn't know, but it was for the best you know. I don't trust these people and neither should you."599,I think abortions should be legal.  Say a female was raped by a stranger or even a family member and became pregnant. She should not have to keep the child.  Say the mother was told while the child was still in the very early stages that it was not a viable pregnancy or they are at risk of dying during birth they should have the choice for abortion600,"I believe that the vaccine mandate issue cuts to the core of what it has meant to be an American and shows the societal undercurrent of dissent on two levels -- that of what is healthy and that of what it means to be free.  It's not a simple question.  There is validity to the notion that a vaccine is of little use, especially in a pandemic situation, if enough of the population doesn't take it.  It cannot adequately protect an individual if that person is one ""dose"" among a crowd of infections.  It's the marginal lessening of huge numbers of people that allow the overall effect to stop the spread of infection.  I see that logic and do not disagree with it.  But the most fundamental truth of being American is to have personal liberty.  An individual has the right to refuse to worship another god, live by another's standards, share another's beliefs and rituals and refuse any body or health related modifications sought by others.  The crux of personal liberty is personal responsibility.  I have the responsibility to carefully consider the state of illness in my world and what the potential costs are for me as I interact with society - including whether to take vaccines.  Personal responibility may lead me to choose for the benefit of my society to take the vaccine.  But the option to not take it has to be there too.  We have to think in terms of the worst case scenerio when evaluating what freedom to lose.  It's true in this situation that vaccines probably are not hurting people and are genuinely the best thing for society and are both created by and controlled by people and instututions who are knowledgeable and well intentioned.  But what if that were not the case?  What if a shady government and/or a shady corporation did produce a sugar pill and dupe the masses into buying it -- or worse, produce a dangerous pill and not warn anyone.  What if a meglomaniac managed to become powerful enough that he could secretly manipulate the situation to spread a harmful drug"601,I am opposed to affirmative action because I believe in meritocracy. I don't believe people should be given a leg up just because of their race or ethnicity. I think people should be admitted to schools based on their academic accomplishments and their intellectual capabilities. I don't believe in hiring people based on their race. It seems to me that affirmative action causes more problems than it solves.602,"Abortion should be illegal. If a woman doesn't want to have a child, there's no reason why she shouldn't deliver the baby and give him/her up for adoption. The baby inside the woman is not part of the woman's body; the baby is a separate entity and just as entitled to life as anyone else. The same people who react with horror to the torture or killing of a defenseless animal will somehow not bat an eye at the murder of a defenseless baby in the womb. Abortion doctors have a lot of euphemisms to disguise the horror of what they're doing (even referring to abortion itself as women's healthcare). One abortion doctor, in disputing someone's claim that the baby screams as it is cut apart, said that was impossible in her case because the first thing she does is sever the baby's vocal cords. I guess she thought she'd won the argument and looked good there. Truly monstrous."603,I’m a Catholic Republican but I am pro-choice. I don’t believe that every sperm is sacred. I feel women should be able to control their own destinies. Children who are unwanted by their mothers could possibly suffer horrible lives and be abused. The world already has enough children in need. I believe women have the right to choose what they want to do with their own bodies. Being forced to carry a child could also possibly destroy the mother’s life. I feel abortion is something that women should always have access to.605,"I hold the view that abortion should be illegal. I believe that a baby is a person and that they have the right to life. I think that intentionally ending their development would be wrong and that they are just as deserving of life as anyone else. I think that woman should have rights to their bodies, but that it gets more complicated once you want to affect another life, and that someone needs to stand up for them since they cannot stand up for themselves."607,"I wrote about affirmative action. It is out of control and has been for some time. It is similar to diversity and inclusion. I am sick of hearing about it.

People need to be hired based on their education; current position in their chosen firld; what their own skillset is - both for soft and other skills and not based on their race or color."608,"The police should not be defunded, I think that would increase crime and people would be less safe.  A vast majority of police are good, and police have saved countless lives."609,"Defunding the police has its positives and its negatives. My opinion on defunding the police is neutral. Some good may come out of it, but a lot of bad may come from it too. Recently in my city, police departments are given grants and money to buy brand new vehicles, build brand new buildings and host other events. While this can be good at times, I wonder where all the rest of the money is going and how much money is given to the police department. Are these people taking the money for themselves as well? Another opinion I have is that it is probably a good thing to fund the police, because that means they will have less a need to pull Americans over to write traffic tickets because they have enough money. Defunding the police can be dangerous because I feel defunding the police may cause police officers to turn on Americans, leading to more police misconduct and more police-citizen deaths. Police brutality may increase, and America may be at risk for more crime because people will no longer want to work as a police officer because of the defunding. It’s a complicated subject, but something needs to be done in order to make sure Americans, AND police are protected."610,I think standardized tests are important. I think that the weight they care as a determination of success in the future is too great! Rather they should be used to allow opportunities to focus education where a student may be lacking so that all students may achieve their best possible success.612,"Affirmative action creates opportunities based on race or gender rather than qualifications.  Thus, the most qualified participants may lose out because they are the wrong gender or ethnicity.  Thus, we all lose."613,"I am passionate about the topic of abortion. I feel it should be legal in certain situations, however, it should not be used as birth control. Morning after pills and birth control need to be cheap/free/accessible to people of all ages. You can’t just say no to abortions without trying to change how this happened in the first place!"617,I would say abortion is the current hot button topic. I feel yes it should have it's place and in cases of health and of course crimes such as rape it should be allowed. I also feel as a society we use abortion as a get out of jail free card. Instead of learning from mistakes and taking responsibility for our actions we just have abortion as a fall back. People need to learn that every action will have a consequence. We have so many easy ways out people never learn and then it is used as a form or birth control and at that point we are not taking anything away from it.618,"I strongly oppose legal abortion.  A child is a person from the point of conception, and to kill an unborn child is tantamount to murder."619,"I believe that abortion should be illegal to the greatest degree possible.  Women who have abortions live with the regret of not knowing what would have become of their child.  Abortion is also the taking of a life that is not the mothers. While it is the mother who is carry the baby, the baby has a right to life as well.  Abortion is not a method of birth control and, unfortunately, that is what it is used for. That needs to stop."620,"I'll take on the vaccine mandate.....we've literally been around the world in our opinions of whether the vaccine for COVID was effective or necessary.  When the virus first hit, we all were seeking ""something"" to help control the spread - we knew nothing about it nor how to make it stop.  Science and medical personnel were scrambling to find something. Finally, someone (?) declared that the newly developed vaccine was the trick to minimizing the spread.  So, we all needed it NOW!!  Jump to today...we're still wondering if it is effective and people are having fits that it is still being mandated in some places.  And, the children - leave the children alone and let them be kids.  I rest my case..."621,"The defunding of the police is the craziest thing I have ever heard of.  How would this work possible work.  The cities would go to chaos and gangs, dealer dealers, and bad people would take over.  If would be a free for all.  Steal cars, looting, breaking into houses.  If this ever did happen, I would definitely be carrying a gun with me at all times."622,"Drugs should be illegal, I believe drugs cause more harm than good. Drugs lead to addiction, and addiction can ruin peoples lives. With alcohol you can take breath test to see there blood alcohol levels. I don't believe with drugs you can do a test to see how high someone. Instead of making it legal, i think they need striker laws on the criminals that manufacture and distribute the drugs. The people that are addicted need more resources to kick the addiction."623,"I believe that vaccinations should not be mandatory. The government needs to stay out of everyone's private business. If you do not want to vaccinate, let everyone else who does get theirs. If the vaccine is effective, the vaccinated have nothing to fear from the unvaccinated. As Dr. Fauci said himself, a year of studies, two years of studies etc. could go by and then all hell breaks loose after twelve years of a bad vaccine. We do not know for sure whether a vaccine is safe even after ten years of trials and studies. We don't have to take a vaccine we don't want, period. Risk is part of life and we all take our own risks."625,"I guess it would be the legalization of illegal drugs. I would be more ok with this getting passed then the other questions. I think law enforcement could be re-allocated to theft and physical crimes. Also, costs of courts and housing the petty drug dealing crimes in jail could be re-allocated to more serious issues. One would be to use those funds on mental health and rehabilitation of users that what/need help."626,"Of these issues I will discuss the idea of mandatory vaccines because I think this relates most closely to the proper rule of government and society.  Any government exists solely to protect the rights of its citizens, one of which is personal liberty and control over one's own livelihood. Forcing people to get vaccinated against their will is usurpation of these rights and liberties.  Furthermore, if a person is fearful of a particular illness it is their responsibility to protect themselves from it.  If vaccines were as effective as advertised, one could protect themselves by taking one and they don't need to force others to do so."628,Drugs629,I believe that affirmative action is in itself racist. It says that various groups couldn’t get into a school or job without help from white people or those in power.630,"Defunding the police. I have lived in rural areas and a city, Las Vegas to be exact. I grew up in the mountains of Virginia and see the cultural differences between large cities and the rural communities. I have traveled much of the U.S and see the difference in issues that different regions face. And how that influences the politics of our nation. In a place like Las Vegas it not shocking to see someone smoking meth at the 7-11 around the corner. In places like where I grew up if your driving 6mph over the speed limit on your way home from work you will get a ticked whereas the meth smoker in Vegas wouldn't be bothered. Defunding police in any situation doesn't make much sense but when they are as corrupt as the perpetrators and unionized and probably over paid for the level of morality that they actually posses I can see the waste that goes into it. But defunding would not solve the issue in either case. All that having less of a police presence would do is make your chance of being shot go up another 5 percent. Defund welfare or other programs that support those that are causing the issues."632,"I am extremely pro vaccine. I trust the science. I've been boosted twice. It's proven that vaccines save lives and prevent severe disease and death in people. However, I feel that it goes against what this country was founded on to force people to take a shot that they don't feel comfortable with. I wish everyone would get the vaccine but it becomes unnecessarily political when you try and mandate it instead of educating people properly about it."634,"I am against abortion, except for special circumstances, such as rape, incest or medical reasons for the child or mother. I am a woman, but it annoys me when women say, ""My body, my choice"". If it is a normal pregnancy, having an abortion is actually getting rid of someone else's body. The woman has an option to not have sex or can easily have protected sex, if they do not want to get pregnant. If someone were to say their dog was going to have puppies, but they did not think they could afford to take care of the puppies, so they were going to abort them, people who agree with abortion for humans would be very upset at the thought of aborting innocent puppies. If you agree with abortion, at what week do you think it should not be allowed? Once the baby can survive on it's own, it is a person. Taking it's life at that point, if it is a healthy baby, should be considered murder. I support abortion, but with limits. I am against abortion, but with exceptions. I would like to know if people who are passionately for abortion have any limits."635,Abortion is a fairly complicated and delicate issue that involves many causes and consequences on the part of the doctor as well as the patient.636,"I believe that drugs should become legalized.  I think it should be up to the individual what they put in their bodies.  I also believe some drugs have medicinal benefits that cannot be studied as easily due to the drugs being illegal.  Additionally, having people go to prison for possessing small amounts of a drug can ruin their lives, which seems ridiculous to me."637,Covid 19 has been a major concern of mine and the introduction of the vaccines calmed that down for me.This vaccine has caused so much tension and most people are frightened of what it would bring. Thankfully the vaccines were introduced to curb the spread of the virus hence the legalization of mandatory vaccine would be beneficial to us all. It would reduce the spread of the virus as well protect us from easily contracting the virus639,"I believe that abortion should be illegal because it is murder. Just because there is a minute chance of an unwanted pregnancy due to rape or medical issue with the mother, it is still murder. 
But there are cases that fall under abortion that may make it hard for women."640,"The police cannot be defunded. The ostensible reason for defunding the police comes from the assertion that the police disproportionately target black citizens. This completely neglects to address the problem of criminality in predominately black neighborhoods and the primary victims of that criminality: black people themselves. 

Since the collapse of the black family as an institution crime has skyrocketed in their neighborhoods. This in turn has resulted in a severe worsening of the same neighborhoods. Black families are left completely incapable of building up even the most basic forms of wealth. There's no reason to save to invest in a newer, more reliable, and ultimately most cost-effective car if their environment destroys it. There's no reason to invest in a local business if shoplifting and blight render it unsustainable. And these problems also in turn increase criminality through economic deprivation, making the problem worse. The only solution is to have a hard and real police presence to completely deprive the criminal element in their communities the opportunity to act. Then, and only then, will their communities ever be able to rebuild and finally break this cycle."641,I think vaccine should be enforced and ask as many people to receive as possible. It can prevent disease spread into others to create mutation. It can also help to save children's lives. It can provide an immune system and help to fight for the disease and make people to freely go outside without any restrictions.642,"I am very much against defunding of police because they have an extremely difficult job.  Officers do not leave their homes wanting to kill people.  Everyday they put their lives on the line and their families don't know if they will come home that night. Instead of defunding, you can provide appropriate training for the officers."646,I think we should legalize most drugs. Marijuana and maybe cocaine. Definitely keep meth illegal. Marijuana is no worse than alcohol. CO legalized it and they have been able to fund school trips with their green tax.650,"I think standardized testing could be restructured due to the anxiety it causes some people to have. I am one of these people and struggled to barely pass these tests in order to get into a normal college. The thought of tests being very limited and timed is unfair and does not measure intelligence with academia. I once took a standardized test that was supposed to be timed and actually scored extremely high. When I'm timed, my anxiety blows my thoughts out of control to the point of physical sickness and terrifying worries."652,"I am against legalizing abortion because I am pro life. Women have many ways to avoid getting pregnant and if they elect to be careless then they should not be allowed to terminate their pregnancy. I strongly believe that the life of the fetus is just as important if not superior to that of the mother.  I would allow abortions in strict cases like incest, sexual violence, or medical reasons that could endanger the women’s life. I would not allow abortions in any other case."656,"I will choose the topic of removing standardized tests from The college application process. My position is that we should not remove standardized tests from college application processes because the test provide a tool for both colleges and students to find a good fit between candidates and schools. While there may be issues with standardized tests I believe the benefits greatly out weight those potential issues. Personally I know that I was considered and accepted to higher quality schools than I otherwise would be due to obtaining exceptional scores on the SAT. I feel that eliminating the SAT from the process would remove a very valuable opportunity for gifted but underprivileged students to show their attitude to learning. I also think that given the large differences in  school district quality, for both public and private schools, in this country the standardized test provide a very valuable tool for college admissions officers to compare students aptitude and abilities, even if it is imperfect."658,"We should not defund police. Yes, some police officers are jerks and don't listen to both sides of the story but police should not be defunded. I worked with adjudicated youth during my career in special education, social services, and mental health and adolescents need to know where the boundaries are. They need to know that if they assault a teacher at school then they will go to jail. I left my job because the juveniles were given too much freedom and were not held accountable for assaulting staff. Getting away with assaulting staff doesn't help the child or the staff. Both sides lose. I worked at a juvenile prison for 10 years and we used to get phone calls from former residents saying ""thank you for holding me accountable"" because that was stability in their life that they otherwise did not have. 
People want to feel safe in their communities. I have heard on independent journalist news videos that people in Democrat cities want the police there because their communities have become more dangerous. In Washington State where I was a state employee, many police officers left due to low morale. I moved away to a Republican state but I hear that crime has increased tremendously in the state of Washington."662,"I think affirmation action is a huge mistake. Having worked in a public high school for almost 30 years  I found that students who qualified for affirmative action were not always prepared academically to the level needed to be successful at certain Universities. They still were intelligent students and I expected them to be very successful students but because of affirmation action ended up in Universities that had academic standards that were just too demanding for them. Ultimately these students wasted time and money going to a university that they did not succeed at, or could not get into the career choice they wanted to at this school. These students clearly would have been better off going to a college with somewhat lesser standards where they could have succeeded in the field they had a strong desire to be in, and would have been extremely successful.  So often white students who were also intelligent, but not necessarily the strongest academic students, did NOT get into the more demanding college (because they did get the bonus of affirmation action) ended up going directly to the lesser college and successfully earning a degree, and then maturing and becoming very successful in their career without wasting time and money at a more challenging school they would not have succeeded at. On a practical level, affirmation action is NOT equitable for anybody. I feel it is a racist system that leads to very predictable outcomes that, like always, hurt the people that they are suppose to help the most."664,I dont think we should defund the police. We owe them for protecting us and our community. We should increase funding for the police so our neighborhoods wouldn't be ridiculed with crime.665,The issue I choose or whether or not to defund the police. I do not believe this should be an option. The major reason I oppose this is because the rate of violent crime will increase. The second reason is I think it would lead people to not feeling safe in their neighborhoods. The last reason is that it will put police at risk because people who choose other professions.668,"I am choosing to write about drug legalization.  I think that many of the lesser drugs should be legalized so that the United States can profit off of the taxes gained from the sale of drugs.  People are probably going to abuse the drugs anyways, so we might as well regulate it and tax it so that some good can come from the practice.  Essentially, we should follow the same path we did with gambling and alcohol/tobacco."669,"We should not abolish standardized testing. I hold this view because if these tests were to be removed, schooling would have less merit if anyone can do anything regardless of scores. Someone should not be able to go to a university without scoring well on these tests."670,"illegality on abortion. 

When I was young abortion was illegal everywhere in the US. That didn’t mean there were no abortions. This was before birth control pills. And before sex Ed in schools. It was the days of groping at the drive-in movies.

It was the days of the back alley abortion, when women got infections, or were botched up and made sterile. Or died.

When you make abortion illegal, you drive it underground. If it’s legal, you don’t have to have one. But some woman or girl does."671,"Defunding the police, goes against human nature.  It is human nature that causes us to choose the easiest way to achieve our goals.  If there is no force to contend and stop them, the stronger more violent people, will smash the weaker, for their resources.   Like many stronger children bully smaller ones, this will occur more often, if not averted by police."672,I am tired of being told that should be held responsible for actions made by individuals or groups from 200 years in the past. I am responsible for my own actions and mine alone.673,I don't think many drugs should be legalized. I don't see why people are fighting for this. Legalizing it means it's even easier for people to access and get addicted to. There are already so many things people can get addicted to that are harmful. Legalizing more drugs will only make things worse.674,"Police Defunding

I take a stance that is completely against police defunding. The reasons for defunding I feel have no comparison to the potential outcome of the negative outcome. If the police are defunded it will take away the ability to fight crime completely. Nobody will defund  criminals and they will find ways to arm themselves and the police will have no way to fight back. The criminals would run wild and make the public a completely unsafe environment for the innocent people and the children who have no involvement. The police make errors like anybody else who works and have to make life and deathe decisions in split seconds so they can return home to their own families. They protect and serve the public for the most part and often aren't the most paid. Sone police dealings may be unwarratned or less important but I believe they are a necessary evil."675,"Abortion is wrong. As a Christian I have always believed that life begins at conception, therefore abortion is murder.  I have been told I am a very black and white person, and I suppose that is correct.  God makes all sorts of people--really smart ones,  really dumb ones, really mediocre ones. Some people have perfect hair and teeth and physiques while other people deal with physical deformities and mental defects.  Today, its seems like people feel if they cannot give birth to a baby that is 100% perfect they should abort it and try again. This is selfish, this is inhuman, yet the leaders of our country are to the point where they believe if a baby is delivered feet first and then its head is punctured and its brains are sucked out then it was never alive to begin with.  How ANYONE can defend this barbaric practice is beyond me, and yet there are doctors today in other countries who advocate for the, well I don't know how they say it, but they believe in ending the life of a child if it has birth defects.  This lack of respect for human life is scary, it is dehumanizing, and it is a symptom of a selfish and corrupt people. It makes me sad."678,It would no longer have act and that we should have other ways to evaluate people's knowledge.679,Abortion should be illegal except in cases of rape or health of the mom being in jeopardy. If Abortion is too readily available then people are too careless in sex an responsibility for their actions. Abortion in my opinion  is a form of murder.680,"I believe drugs should be legalized because our prison system is clogged with people who are addicts rather than criminals. Addiction is expensive because it is illegal, and that is what gives cartels and gangs power. If it is decriminalized, people who need help getting free of their addiction can more easily find that help. Sending them to prison turns them into worse criminals and further disempowers them."681,"Students should still be required to take a standardized assessment in order to enroll for college. A timed test gives both students and colleges and universities feedback about students' academic progress. A student does not want to enroll in a university, where costs are very high, if they have little to no chance at having success toward a four-year degree. Spending thousands of dollars and then dropping out of college could have a significant economic effect upon a student's economic future. Saddling themselves with high levels of debt with little to no way of repaying it is not a great way to start out in life. Therefore, students need to see what their progress is in math, English and science reasoning, three skills necessary when attempting to obtain a four-year degree. A decent way to assess students' progress is with a standardized test such as the ACT or SAT. Agencies that provide scholarships also need to see students' skills and who they should invest their money in. A student's ACT score is a good predictor of their GPA in their first semester of college. It is worthwhile both to students and to universities to consider a student's ACT score to help determine whether a student is a good fit for a university or not. The ACT score does not need to be the defining factor in college admission, but it does need to play a part. The more information that is present, the better it is for both the student and the university. We should keep ACT scores in the college admission process to help everyone make good, informed decisions about the future of students!"683,"Defund the police. 
If you remove those funds, people will not have the protection that is needed. Some cities you can't even own a firearm so between the police defunded and you not having an equalizer to defend yourself, what does one do? Roll over and be raped/robbed/murdered? Instead of defund the police, how about expand police to include a mental health component with experts who work hand in hand. More over sight, more training."684,"I choose to discuss why I am against vaccine mandates. There is nothing more sacred to the individual than the control of their own body. For anyone to forcibly administer any substance into another's body is highly immoral. Additionally, with mandates, nobody is held accountable for the certain harm that will take place, and there is no recourse for being harmed. It can not be undone, and is a permanent approach that may not even solve the problem. There were far too many unknowns with the covid vaccine, and the data is still coming in and does not look good. Vaccine mandates are unethical, immoral, and certainly harmful."686,Police should not be defended. We need to have a society with laws. If we have no Police then crime will happen more.688,"I feel abortion should be illegal,   Abortion is a procedure that does not address the root cause of a problem.  It merely erases it.    Abortions destroy the family unit.   Abortion ends the lives of innocent babies who are not given a choice on whether they wish to live or not.  Abortion is a cop-out."691,I oppose legalization of drugs.  I think it leads to more problems than solutions.  It's the start of addiction and life filled with addiction issues.694,Abortion Should be legal because our society cannot take on all those unwanted children That would be born to mostly low income and minority families and would grow up to commit crime.  Until there is definitive proof that life starts at consumption abortion should continue to be legal. I believe that abortion should be everyone's personal choice.  However it should be a shameful thing that you try to avoid and society should see it as shameful and no one should see it as some sort of empowering thing However it should be a shameful thing that you try to avoid and society should see it as shameful and no one should see it as some sort of empowering thing.696,I think a woman should always be allowed the choice in Reaganism to an abortion.  A child could wind up in an abusive home or have a worse life if the mother can not provide.  Also what if the child is a product of rape or abuse?  A woman should not be forced to have a child she does not want.  Sometimes it is also medically necessary to save the mothers life or prevent a severe birth defect.  The option should always be there.701,"I think it is important to maintain standardized testing as part of the college application process because it levels the playing field for comparison against students across the country. Each school has a different set of teachers, classes, procedures, and grading skills, so it is impossible to equally compare students based on their performance within their schools. Standardized testing allows everyone to be compared on the same stage, and shows a true ranking in comparison to other students."702,I believe abortion should be legal.  Women have the right to choose and should not be denied this.  Not everyone has to get an abortion and people can still choose as they want.  The underlying part is they need to be free to choose.703,"I honestly am not sure if im understanding the question correctly. I gave my pros and cons about three topics, not sure what your meaning about writing about my position. Can you assist and I can answer this for you. Sorry"704,"I don't feel that vaccines should be mandatory.  I don't feel that the government should be able to force anyone to be injected with any vaccine that may be harmful to an otherwise healthy person.  Regardless of the ample data showing individuals who have suffered tragic side-effects, the government is continuing to push this agenda.  It's not up to any government to impede upon a person's decision to risk exposure to Covid.  Especially since the vaccines do not prevent Covid, nor the spread of Covid, nor people dying from Covid.  I know of a few individuals who are suddenly sick with ailments they never had before or passed away after being ""fully vaccinated"". It just seems really strange that, in light of that, it is still something that the government is trying to push."705,"Abortion should be legal.   While I am personally opposed to abortion, who am I to tell someone what they can do to their body.  Abortion, vaccine mandates are the same issue for me.  Keep the government out of my choices for health care.  In addition, on the abortion issue, your body, your choice, you accept the responsibility for any consequences of your actions."706,"I believe that standardized testing should not be a requirement for college admission. I think that they encourage students to excessively focus on a narrow type of achievement that won't serve much of a long-term purpose in their lives. The time spent preparing for such tests could be used to participate in the arts, sports, or some other endeavor with long-term benefits. These tests also put such a tremendous amount of additional stress on students. Reducing stress can help improve their mental health and overall functioning in various ways."707,Abortion.  I hold the view that babies should be offered the same legal protections before birth.708,I’m choosing Affirmative Action and I am choosing the position Of being against it. I feel this practice isn’t fair to those who work harder and want to make their life better. People should be chosen on merit and not by demographics. If someone works hard to be a better candidate for a job or admissions in school and weren’t selected because of the color of their skin or gender that would make people less likely to want to try hard and everyone would be hurt. It’s a racist practice and instead the money and planning should be spent to give the people this is trying to help some help earlier in life to learn the skills to be a better selection.709,"I am for affirmative action and do not believe it should be dissolved. Affirmative action should only be for black Americans that have had lineage in the United States since the 1800s. When other groups are granted priveleges such as the Native Americans and Jewish, they are never required to share with other groups of people. Immigrants come to America voluntarily and have a choice to leave if they believe America to be so dicriminatory. If you give affirmative action to everyone except heterosexual white men, it's diluted to the point where the original group it was intended for due to their history in America not as an immigrant or voluntarily are for the most part excluded from it."710,I am a nurse. It is difficult to tell people they have to take a vaccine. Once shots were given to go to school.  There is no difference here. People  have a right to live and others should protect them by doing what is morally correct.711,"I agree that vaccines, that are thoroughly vetted, should be mandatory. The COVID-19 vaccines were not and should not be mandatory."716,I believe that abortion absolutely has to be legal in every state.  I think that denying abortion is a travesty to women and will set them back 50 years. Legal access to abortion is an important right.  It is no one's business who has an abortion and for what reason.  A woman should be able to choose what to do with her own body and access to abortion means women can choose their own path in life.717,I am in favor of abortion being illegal in all circumstances. Because abortion it is morally wrong to kill a person and abortion does that which is against God's laws for mankind. It also results in many deaths of pregnant women.718,"Most women who are pro abortion always talk about having control over their bodies, but does the unborn child not have any rights?"719,Abortion - I amagainst it because it kills a living human being that was created by God and no man/woman has the right to kill it.720,"Abortion is murder, plain and simple.  It is the deliberate taking of a human life, and no amount of euphemistic sophistry can hide that.  Abortion is not ""reproductive care"".  To abort a pregancy is to possibly abort the future scientist or physician, the man who finally discovers a ""theory of everything"" or the woman who discovers the cure for cancer.  If humans are mere clumps of cells and not the crown of evolution, then why should we aspire to anything, let alone the pinacles of art and knowledge?"722,"As for abortion, I am coming to the topic from a position of a Christian who sees all life as sacred and the act of murder to be, simply, the taking of someone else's life. As soon as a baby is conceived, it begins to grow and develop and live. There is no difference between a 24-week baby in utero and a 24-week miracle preemie. Did one have more right to live? They are both humans and no one, not even the motehr, has a right to end that life."727,"I don't feel that hard drugs should be legalized. If drugs are readily available, people will tend to use them to their own detriment. It's easy to get addicted and in the end it causes more social dysfunction and imposes a cost on society."728,Choosing to end Affemeration action and I am in favor of ending it.730,I do not believe in mandatory vaccinations.  I believe it is our constitutional right to choose what we do and don't put in our bodies.735,"Abortion should be illegal, except under certain conditions, after first trimester, it should mo longer be allowed, unless the mothers life is in danger, or it's a child of rape or incest, or the baby has severe deformities, or isn’t viable. Too many women use anortions as birth control, and some wait until almost birth to abort, it's not your body after you become pregnant, you are sharing it with another life. Lots of girls today don't even take one single precaution to avoid pregnancy, and think nothing of getting rid of it. I know there are a lot of women that won’t care for their child, or abuse them, and some could say that that baby was better off not existing, sex is something there girls just play with, there is no commitment, it's just fun and games. If you are ready for sex you need to be ready to handle the consequences of having it. If you don't want a child you take every precaution everytime, if you do get pregnant there is adoption."737,"I hold the view that abortion should be illegal. You can argue all day about the situation the baby was conceived in, but it is still a baby. You are killing a human life. It is illegal to destroy turtle eggs because they will hatch one day and be turtles. Why is it ok for humans to kill something that will one day be born and be a human. I am a Christian and I believe that every life has value. God created every person in his image. He died for every person. Who are we to take the life of someone that He has created?"741,"Obviously, police should not be defunded. Policing is one of the central functions of government. If government refuses to perform this function, then the ""function"" is performed in ways that are far less just. The rich will hire their own private police. The more virile among the lower classes will recognize that they must take the law into their own hands and inflict punishment and deterrence on lawbreakers and potential lawbreakers. Others will simply became much more cautious in their dealings with others and society will become much more clannish. Many of the people advocating defunding the police and working in conjunction with the CCP to weaken the US. These people should be arrested by the police and sentenced to harsh punishment."744,With the increase  in theft and other crimes nothing is more important than the  police. The police  risk their lives to keep people safe745,"Affirmative action policies are one of the most overblown and least understood topics in modern society and it is my position that I simply do not care about it one way or the other. My position is based on the assumption that I understand the policy correctly, and I feel that I am 80% confident this is the case. 

At present, affirmative action policies are applicable only to businesses that contract with the federal government. I believe this extends to organizations that receive government funding as well, such as the case with public universities. Because of this, there exists only a small fraction of organizations where these hiring practices are a matter of issue. 

Affirmative action policies lack an executive enforcement clause. There is no set standard for the diverse workforce requirements and so there is no"746,"I choose abortion because it is the subject that needs the most attention. I have a great friend that I admire and respect very much, she is my wife's sister  ,she was the victim of assault and rape 12 years ago, her attacker is still on the loose. She was hospitalized for over a month from the brutal attack, and she was pregnant, she refused to have an abortion despite what anyone said"747,"I think affirmative action is the most ridiculous argument to date I have heard in our country. By definition any decision that is made based on the color of someone's skin and not the content of their character is racist. It is also condescending and patronizing to people of color. It is almost as though ignorant white people are saying ""ooohhhh those poor dumb black people who probably didnt have good parents and dont know how to work hard like white people and aren't as smart as white people need us to cut them a break and give them a job they would never be smart enough to get on their own. Poor black people"". Racism is racism and Race should never play a factor in what someone is or is not given or how someone is perceived or not perceived."748,"I believe that the use of drugs for personal consumption is not a crime. There's no victim and it's reprehensible that drug users sometimes get more prison time than violent offenders. Drug dealing is a different story, especially if they are dealing in laced pills which is a big problem today. Personal use, however, should be treated with compassion and help rather than throwing the book at them."751,"People shouldn't defund the police. They are here to protect  us and in the process of defunding the police, more civilians and police would die. There would also be even more crime in the streets and for many situations which police could deal with today, if they were defunded it would be a lot harder thing to fix."752,"I feel the COVID vaccine was rushed into production and therefore insufficiently tested. It was dishonestly sold to the public as a preventative to COVID, and now we are seeing this is not the case. Many credentialed medical experts were deplatformed and driven underground for simply raising questions about the mRNA vaccines; their voices were not sufficiently heard, and thus the people were denied informed consent. Finally, how can you force people to take a vaccine the producers of which have prosecutorial immunity if anything goes wrong. Didn't we learn anything from the Swine Flu vaccine of 1976? This vaccine was not sufficiently tested either, and people were panicked and herded into compliance without informed consent. Many grave illnesses including paralysis resulted. No one should be compelled under force of law to submit to any kind of medical treatment."753,"I believe abortion should be legal up until a certain point of the pregnancy. I believe that women should have the right to chose what happens to their body. During the 1st trimester of a pregnancy, the fetus barely has a heartbeat and has not developed hardly at all, which I think should be the timeframe for legal abortions, the 1st trimester, nothing more. I feel it should be legal because there are so many unexpected and unplanned situations that can cause pregnancy, such as rape, the partner not being truthful about using contraception correctly, or even an accident where the contraception has a hole that wasn't seen or noticed prior. These situations, especially a pregnancy caused by Rape should be understood by every human being and should be legal. I think it is absolutely terrible for someone to tell a woman pregnant by a rape ""you cant get an abortion, you have to have this baby"" knowing the baby will potentially be a constant reminder of the horrible experience. Even when its a situation where a teenager isnt smart/careful and becomes pregnant should be legal. Everyone makes mistakes, especially in their teenage years, if a young girl does not want to put her college dreams or any life dreams on a huge timeout because of a bad decision i believe that potential teen mother can use a situation like this as a learning experience,"754,"I believe that any woman has the right to have an abortion or not have an abortion without anybody dictating what they should or should not do. If a woman is raped, she should not have to have the baby because it is a psychological reminder of what had happened to her and it will only cause resentment for her and the baby for the rest of their lives. While if she does have the abortion, she will get the help that she needs and she will be able to move on from the incident. I do believe that there needs to be very clear guidelines on when it is too late to have an abortion."757,"Abortion should be illegal in almost all cases. The only exceptions should be when the Mother's life is at risk. In this event it's necessary to save the living individual and sacrifice the baby. In today's society abortions are utilized to escape one's poor decisions. While the argument can be made for abortions surrounding rape and incest, those scenarios are minuscule compared to the actual use of abortions. Too many Mother's are killing their children because they don't want the hassles of being a parent. This is rather selfish and doesn't prevent the individual from making poor decisions in the future. If you're not willing or ready to be pregnant, do not have unprotected sex. In the event that you're not careful, one should face the consequences. If unprepared or incapable of being a parent, there's always adoption. The birth-rates of the current generation are lower than in the past, and at some point, being a selfish person that doesn't want to sacrifice and have children will be detrimental to society."759,Drug legalization. I believe that drugs should not be legalized because it will make people have easy access to it and it would promote violence and cause harm760,"Vaccine mandates are a terrible idea ands sets a dangerous precedent for the future of government to overstep and abuse their people. You cannot have the right to deny people food and the right to make a living based on a vaccine let alone a vaccine that hasn't been able to be criticized or even tested properly.
It is a medical procedure and every individual should have the ability to judge for themselves if they want to assume the risks or not based on their own individual circumstances and health."764,Legalizing drugs. I am against legalizing drugs. I believe the number of drug users would increase. It definitely sends the wrong message to children. There would be much addiction and dependency. My daughter was an addict. I personally would not vote to legalize it.765,"SAT testing. I believe testing should remain. There are way too many instances of where college admissions have become political, with demographics and diversity issues trumping  merit and intelligence. Smarter, harder working, brilliant students should get into the top colleges. Not differentiating using one more measure to test intelligence makes the general population at any given school ""less."" We need less dumbing down of our institutions, not more."767,"When it comes to legalizing illicit drugs I think they should be decriminalized but that most shouldn't be legalized beyond medical use. Many addicts in unfortunate situations are victims be it of circumstance or otherwise, but for many of them and the average person we can't assume they can handle every type of drug even, if it can offer positive effects; such as ""magic mushrooms"" that can lead to bad trips, or even psychosis in huge doses that we can't be sure the average person won't try."768,I strongly support making abortion illegal because I believe it is morally wrong and my religious beliefs also say that it is wrong.  I think that people who are willing to create a child should be willing to take care of the child and not just kill it.770,"Vaccines should be mandatory
For me, Vaccines should be mandatory as it is very important to be vaccinated. We all know that vaccination is the act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce protection from a specific disease and also bring about immunity. Vaccines have greatly reduced diseases that once routinely harmed or killed babies, children, and adults. Therefore is is important that all gets vaccinated so that we stand a greater chance of being protected. Vaccine-preventable diseases have not gone away. Let us help the government to help ourselves."771,I think the police shouldn't be defunded because the police are necessary to combat crime. Defunding them will just lead to increased crime and therefore more innocent victims of crime.772,"I think affirmative action should continue, but it needs to be changed. From my observation, Black males have not benefitted from this policy as much as intended. Women also fall under affirmative action. Firms that hire a woman that is black often are able to ‘check 2 boxes’ with affirmative action compliance. This made it to where many Black women were hired over Black men that may have been more qualified. Also, women of any race allow companies to ‘check a box’, which seems to be against the spirit of what this policy was intended."773,"Affirmative action is sorely needed, still, but should be based on economic status not superficial visual effects like skin color, ethnic heritage, etc.
Special consideration should be based not solely on merit, nor race, nor gender:  appropriate affirmative action in educational opportunity, employment, promotions, financial aid, etc. should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the complete background of the individual candidate and all relevant factors.
This is a more difficult, more labor-intensive, and likely a more expensive approach, but it is also far more fair than any of the crude broad-brush pigeon-holing foolishness that currently applies far too often.
It is indisputable that redress of legitimate grievances that have resulted from prolonged oppression is crying out for corrections to be applied.  Speculation must be replaced with information, and thought and care are mandatory to avoid a ""cure"" that addresses only the superficial symptoms without correcting the root causes of the fundamental problem.  Perceptions of inappropriate 'gift' advantages to undeserving recipients harm both the granter and the grantee, even when inaccurate."776,"Pros and Cons of why affirmative action should be dissolved

The government policy, Affirmative Action, which goes by different names in other countries (sometimes referred to as “positive discrimination”), is created to promote equality among minority groups in the US and to protect them from racist injustice and hate crimes. Generally, it means giving preferential treatment to minorities in employment, businesses, and admission to universities. It was also originally developed to correct years of discrimination and to give boosts to disadvantaged groups. With the diversity of our society today, it seems that the programs coming with the policy have been successful. However, many people already think that it is no longer necessary and that it would lead to problems more than it has solved. While they claim that this move would generate positive results, there are always two sides to every story. So, let us take a closer look at the pros and cons of Affirmative Action."778,"I do not believe the police should be defunded. It is hard to believe that the push to defund the police is as widespread as it appears to be based on news stories.  Defunding police departments gives criminals the green light to commit crimes without the fear of any punishment. All one has to do is look at communities where defunding steps have been implemented to know that this is true. In many major cities thieves have been committing brazen robberies of high end stores without any apparent fear that they will be caught and prosecuted. These robberies have caused many stores to close because of financial losses. Violent crime, especially in the larger cities has also increased. Law abiding citizens have a right to feel safe and secure. It is the responsibility of the government to protect its citizens. Defunding the police will do the opposite. And just an aside, any politician who promotes this belief should be removed from office. The whole concept is perverse and ridiculous."779,"I am fine with drug realization, at least in theory. However, I have reservations as to how it will play out in practice. I do not want there to be even more addicts stumbling around the streets, and I especially do not want more of my tax dollars being spent on providing drugs to them."780,"I do not think that abortion should become illegal because there are so many situations in life that just show that abortion is a better choice. But I do believe that abortion should be illegal in late stages and that abortion should not be so easily provided and normalized as it was in many states. I know a person who had 8 abortions and this is when she was still young and I communicated with her, who knows how many more she had later in life. I do not thing that it is normal. To persona like that, there should be psychologist and social workers, doctors all sitting down and talking to her. That should be done with first abortion and probably with every next abortion it should be harder and harder to get. Maybe even there should be limit how many legal abortions one female is allowed to have. But overall, it should be legal."783,"Defending the police is not a good thing. The more police, the more law and order.Right now the police are given a hard time.Less police embolden the criminals to commit more crimes."786,"Abortion is wrong, it can never be right to kill a human being, no matter the circumstances.  I am so happy that Roe V Wade was overturned.  If the majority of people with unwanted pregnancies practiced safe sex to begin with, this issue wouldn't be as mountainous as it is.  There are so many people who want children, but for medical reasons are unable to conceive.  We must have a program in place for unwanted pregnancies, we must have a law where these babies go to people who want children, but cannot have them.  It shouldn't cost 10's of thousands of dollars to do this or even adopt, many people simply cannot afford that.  Most importantly, God says killing an innocent being is wrong.  God is against abortion and that should be reason enough to make it illegal.  Morally abortion is so very wrong."793,Abortion should be neither be legal or illegal. The government has no business interfering with personal health choices. People should have the freedom to make their own health decision including right to die. The idea that we should be investing so heavily in extending and perpetuating human life has resulted in overpopulation of the planet and environmental disaster. We need to cull the herd and should not prevent a woman from electing not to contribute to the problem.794,"I believe that mandatory vaccination is an extremum violation of human and American rights. 
Forcing individuals pump their personal bodies and their own children with chemicals that have very little testing is psychotic. We the people have the right to choose our own health practices and the path of our own children. We have the right to follow our religions.
Big pharma and their investors benefit heavily while the citizens are tested like lab rats. While the rich get richer, our citizens are left with the choice to risk medical injuries or our jobs. Even practicing freedom of speech and thought has been beaten down with an Iron fist. 
I stand firmly against this."797,I believe abortion is a moral issue and should be legal. It should be a decision left up to the woman/couple and their doctor. I believe it would be dangerous for it to be illegal because it could lead to woman doing abortions at home.798,My most firm position would probably be on abortion. And that's because I'm a male and I feel like one gender shouldn't tell another gender what they can or can not do. Especially since I'll never experience having to carry around a child and the impact that could have on me on my day to day. Also i'll never experience a rape like a woman can. To be raped and to be pregnant with the child of the rapist is an amount of pain I could never fathom.799,Legalization of illicit drugs - I don't think it's a good idea to do it for any man made drugs. The danger is just too high that someone high on illicit drugs will commit a crime. I do believe though that these people should be sent to therapy not to jail unless they commit violent crime or something like that in the process.  Addicts need treatment if they ever hope to get better.  Jail will  not help. There they can continue to take drugs.9,"For mandatory vaccines, I hold this position because I think it's important to keep yourself and others healthy. While I believe in self-determination, I also believe that lots of people don't take the time to become educated on topics. However, mandatory vaccines can infringe on religious beliefs, which is complicated. I personally think mandatory vaccines should be implicated because one's decision whether or not to get a vaccine affects other people's health as well."11,"Personally, I am in agreement with standardized testing to be removed from school. In my experience, I took the SAT and I didn’t even decide to go to a university, I just went to community college. In my case, I didn’t even need to spend the money to take the SAT just to go to another four years of schooling. So, I don’t oppose the idea of removing standardized testing."16,I oppose defunding the police because I feel it will negativity affect socitity. Defunding the police would increase criminal and violence activity. Cops should be held accountable if they do something wrong but the whole department should not be affected.21,"I think most drugs should be decriminalized. I think it would help prevent unnecessary crime related to the underground trafficking of drugs. It would also give people more freedom to do what they want in their downtime. I don't think it would lead to more people abusing hard drugs, as those people find a way if they want to"27,"Mandatory vaccines.
It makes sense to mandate vaccines. They work. They prevent illness. They help our society grow."31,"I don't feel affirmative action is effective. The policy of affirmative action is intended to improve the fairness of hiring practices by enforcing diversity. However, enforcing diversity inversely decreases hiring fairness, as folks are not hired for their worth to the company, rather, a statistic to meet diversity requirements. Additionally, it further promotes anger and bigotry, as certain people are treated differently from others."59,Abortion. Women should be able to make decisions about their body.64,"I think the police should be defunded because they're given way too much money. I don't have the evidence right in front of me, but I have seen studies that show allocating police funds into other programs like social welfare, public schools, etc. actually do more to improve crime rates than giving more money to the police."78,Abortion is murder. Killing babies is always wrong. Even if they think it may endanger the mother to have the baby. Only God knows for sure what will happen to the mother. He will spare both her's and the baby's life. He is a wonderful God!83,"I think affirmative action is an outdated relic from an oppressive time that did not give chances fairly. Now, practically anyone can claim this status, which makes it practically useless at best, and insulting at worst. Also, it is diverse on the surface only, as there is no guarantee that diversity of skin tone equates to diversity of thought"87,"Abortion is a complicated subject because there are situations where it is understandable to have an abortion. I was molested when I was younger and if I had gotten pregnant, I would not want to raise his child. It would be incest as well as having to be reminded of that experience every day. However, I can't get past the fact that you are killing a human being. If a murderer kills a pregnant woman, they are charged for double murder. So how come abortion isn't the same thing? I am completely conflicted over this issue."94,"I believe that abortions should be legal because they are beneficial to women's health needs. Medical abortions are often needed due to issues with the pregnancy. If the baby cannot be safely carried to term, the mother's shouldn't be afraid to medically terminate their pregnancy. There are also cases of rape victims that don't wish to continue carrying the child of their attacker. Ultimately, the decision should fall to the pregnant women whose lives will be altered by the pregnancy. Making abortions illegal doesn't stop them from occurring. It just limits the safe options."103,"I believe that abortion should be legal, because it is up to a women if she wants one or not. No you can tell her want to do with her body. Just like Republicans argument on vaccine, my body my choice."104,"I believe abortion is health care and is a woman’s right. Making abortion illegal not only just stops access to safe abortions, but infringes on reproductive care. If we don’t force men to abide by certain body laws, we shouldn’t expect the same of women."105,"All drugs should be legalized and regulated. All of them. From heroin to MDMA, there is no drug more deadly than alcohol, no drug more addictive than sugar, and no drug more prevalent than caffeine, and all are legal. But all other substances are demonized and called ""dangerous."" They are illegal not for scientific reasons, but for political ones. Regan started his drug war to demonize black people and yet the CIA brought cocaine into the inner cities and started making crack, making one of the most expensive drugs cheap and easily available. Which was a way to incarcerate black and low income people. It's all a scam. It's all a lie. MDMA can CURE PTSD with proper therapy. Ketamine has saved my life multiple times, it is an AMAZING antidepressant. I'm not even going to talk about weed, since it's so safe, it's not worth discussing. Mushrooms and LSD are also powerful medicines. And if someone wants to take heroin, after learning about it, they should be able to do so legally, with clean needles, and with the right dose. No one should be able to decide what drug I can and cannot do. Old white rich uneducated white men who make the laws know nothing of neurosciences or pharmacology, yet they decide LSD is schedule I, along with heroin with ""no medical usage."" Bullshit."111,I think vaccines should be mandatory because of the health effects and immunity they bring to the people and the community around them. The side effects for the people that get them are so small compared to the amount of people that receive the benefits.116,I think standard tests are trying to do something good but there are a lot of barriers to them fulfilling their promise. First off not all students do well on tests. Students learn differently and some do well at taking tests and others do not. Students that have more money are able to get access to classes and tutors to help them do better whereas poorer students might not have the resources.117,I think abortion should be legal because people should have the right and free will to do what they please with there specimens. Some people cannot afford to have babies but were just engaging in something very casual that can spin out of hand. this can set many people back and change the trajectory of their lives.119,I am against vaccine mandates because my niece stopped breathing after her 4 month shots and my kids sibling started having seizures after her 12 month shots. I don't think everyone should get shots as you never know how ones body would react to the toxic ingredients. It should be up to each person and how they feel about vaccines120,Illegal drugs making it illegal. I am totally against this because I believe so many precious lives will be able to get these drugs so much easier.136,"Abortion should be legal in all 50 states. I firmly believe a woman should have the right to choose whether or not she carryout a pregnancy. It makes no difference if the pregnancy is a result of rape, or a married couple conceiving. It should not be a decision for policy makers, religious leaders, or anyone who aims to force an unwanted pregnancy on a woman."143,"Abortion -  Because I'm female and I had an abortion when I was a teenager, 15 years old. I was at a family member's house and they were having a party. Some of their less-known guests drugged me and I was raped by one of the men. I was completely alone and didn't receive much support or understanding, and I didn't even know what was changing with my body because I would have never chosen to be abused and become pregnant. If it were forced upon me, that I must follow through with the pregnancy, I would have had a much different life, not necessarily for the better.  I wasn't able to take care of myself on my own then, and it would be inhumane to have a child and perpetuate the same situation."147,"I think that ACT tests should not be the only part of submission because that doesn't say anything about you as a student, they should rather take into account your academic performance as a whole and judge your character."149,"The issue I choose is abortion. I believe that abortion should be between a woman and her doctor and no one else. I think that current laws are sexist and misogynistic as well as bad for society as a whole. Women are happier and more successful as a whole when they have access to abortion, and abortion is, in my opinion, necessary for an equal society. All abortion should be legal, even late-term, and minors should be able to get abortions without parental approval. I believe this because I think no woman should have to be pregnant if she does not want to. It is a bodily autonomy issue."154,Vaccine mandate - I support because it could lower risk for all.157,"One of the issues I was presented with I support is that of defunding the police.  While I do not feel all cops are bad, I also do not feel cops should hold all the roles they do.  Cops shouldn't be expected to go after criminals and also be mental health therapists.  Police need to focus on what they do best and that is preventing crime.  We need social workers on the force to go to or backup police on situations in which it's about something dealing with mental health.  In these situations we shouldn't be quick to arrest, but rather try to help.  This is why I stand with the defunding the police movement because I do not like the idea of police having to essentially wear multiple hats being not only a cop, but a psychologist as well.  They're simply not trained nor educated enough to handle all these roles.  They should fight crime, and leave the rest to trained professionals who would be better at handling situations such as a mental breakdown or drug intervention."163,"Legal Drugs: The best way to take the hands of organized crime and drug cartels out of the way of doing things and filling their hands with money illegally, allowing some drugs to be grown legally by farmers in our state, and our certified laboratories to supply some recreational drugs safely, while at the same time eliminating crime in the streets by the illicit sale of narcotics and the transport of drugs illegally through airports and other means."164,"No one with common sense should defund the police. It is one of the most stupidest things, I have heard in a while. Sounds like a liberal utopia, where they can go around and commit crimes. They lack their logic and only fall under the echo chambers of sheer stupidity from main stream media. Are they corruption in police departments? Of course. But they also massive corruption in politics and no one is going on to defund the government."182,"The issue I will choose is legalizing abortion. My opinion is that it is an individual's choice on what they want to do with their body and if they have to have a pregnancy or not. Being pregnant should not be a punishment for having sex, and we have the medical technology and pills to safely abort babies, so we should use them."188,"I feel all drugs should be legalized and regulated by the government. This would allow safer access for people who are going to use drugs anyway and reduce the risks and deaths associated by doing illegal, shady transactions with strangers/drug dealers who do not have the best intentions. This provides pure drugs vs something potentially laced with something lethal. It gives the opportunity for a controlled, safe environment to use these substances in. It reduces the stigma associated with illegal drug use and treats it as a health issue which would allow more resources available to accept and treat said health issues. I forget which country has already done it, but one has and its been more successful than not. It also brings more money and resources in to the government, hopefully to the states. It's good for all levels from the citizen to the federal government to treat it as a health issue and not something criminal. It should be regulated like alcohol."194,"Abortion should be legal in all states, in all cases, zero exceptions, up to the moment of birth. Women and other people with the ability to become pregnant have many complicated reasons for receiving abortions, none of which should be controlled by the state at all. Some women don't want to be pregnant, some don't want a baby, some are at risk of health complications, some do not have health insurance, etc. There are zero wrong reasons for wanting an abortion, and until that fetus is out of it's mother, it is a parasitic growth with no rights of it's own and should be treated as such. Women have less bodily autonomy than a corpse, because even a person before death is able to choose whether or not their organs are donated, but now a woman must donate her body by law to a thing that is not even a person yet. Anyone against abortion is against women's rights, and does not care if women live or die."201,I have been a drug addict and still am who was addicted to heroine.  Sometimes getting heroine can put you in dangerous situations and you don’t know what your getting.  People rob and steal for these drugs and use dirty needles.  Getting myself in the methadone clinic saved my life.  I have been clean for 3 years.  To have places like that for addicts where they can safely get the drugs they need and they help would be better than putting these people in prison.  At the methadone clinic they just don’t hand me drugs.  I go to many counseling appointments and am seen by a doctor on a regular basis.  This kind of system with drugs would only benefit.204,Drugs should not be legalized because they are dangerous and cause people to make dangerous and wrong choices. This will lead to crime and dangerous situations within everbodys community.214,"I am a biologically female person who has had an abortion. It is an important issue to me because women should never under any circumstances be told what to do with their own bodies. Men would never have such laws applied to them, they suffer no consequences when they had equal part in the act. Religious concerns should NEVER EVER be used as an argument when there is supposed to be separation of church and state in this country."215,"(I want to state here that I am not for abortion being illegal, I think I may have answered that one incorrectly based on confusion with how it was worded.)

Every female should have the ability to choose what is best for herself and her body when it comes to having a baby. Abortion should not be illegal. Abortions being illegal harms victims of rape and incest. It harms unwanted children and burdens foster care families. It forces children to be born into homelessness, drug use, mental health issues, etc, that could be avoided given a woman's ability to choose.

Abortions being illegal also make it harder for women who are experiencing unsafe pregnancies or unviable pregnancies to get the care that they require. It puts women's lives at risk."217,I am a strong believer that abortion should be legal in all instances and should be supported financially by the federal government. Access to an abortion is crucial for women regardless of the reason.222,"Affirmative action goes against the very thing it says it stands for. It is supposed to be giving those once discriminated against an advantage over others. This in and of itself is discriminatory to all those others. So are we saying it's the ""others"" turn to be discriminated against? Is that OK? Affirmative action is being judged by the color of your skin. Isn't that racist? Why don't we just eliminate race and skin color all together from applications? Why can't we just pick based on hard work and merit? Isn't that the fairest way? One can't help what color they were born as. But they can help how hard they work for something."231,"abortion:
should be legal because the choice should not be put into the hands of some old men, it should be the choice of the women. they should get the choice. without legal aborttions, its not going to stop sbortions its just gonna mke womne look for less safe options"232,"Drugs have been criminalized for too long, there are drugs that hurt no one and should be legal."234,"I fully support legalizing abortion because women should be able to do what they want with their bodies. It is nobody elses business. Some women have complicated pregnancies, some women get raped, and unfortunately some of those are young girls. It is a shame people would want to withhold that freedom of choice from them and run higher risks."243,"SAT/ACT. I work at a college and I think the SAT/ACT can be improved, or adjusted, but still think the objective external scores are valuable to make decisions about entry. Especially for remedial classes and getting students into the right content area. Without SAT/ACT students are not placed correctly, or the schools needs to have more placement and testing at the school to determine which basic classes the students can start with during their freshman year. Students are extremely underprepared for college academically and do not have some of the needed academic ability and SAT/ACT, while not perfect can help identify students who need a bit more assistance early in college if done correctly."254,"I choose mandated vaccines. It is nobodies business, especially the government, to decide what I put in my body. Perhaps if the vaccine was proven to reduce the spread of Covid I would feel differently, but right now it is not. I have watched family members get boosters and become very sick with Covid, yet I have not gotten one shot and have not gotten sick at all. A medical decision is nobodies choice but the patient."255,"I agree with the legalization of illicit drugs, because I believe it would spur more honest conversations about the reality of addictions. And it would cause more mental health, resources, community resources, treatment, centers, and more resources for families and single parents, struggling with addictions. And minors in those in compromised and unsafe situations. The drug issue is a mental health issue, and if it was viewed as a mental health issue and I was something we could help as a community. It wouldn’t be viewed as an choice or a moral fault."257,"I think there needs to be a federal bill supporting abortion. Women are not the property of the federal government, so they should get to make their own decisions."258,"I am strongly against banning abortion because access to abortion is essential for people's health and well-being. For example- if abortion is banned except in cases of death of the mother, a miscarriage could mean the end of a woman's life because the line between certain death and possible death can be unclear or impossible to prove. Finding a doctor willing to risk losing their license or imprisonment will be extremely difficult. There are so many scenarios that make banning abortion the opposite of a pro-life position."263,"I am for the most against legalization of illicit drugs. The main reason is the devastating physical, mental, and emotional effects on individuals who become involved with or addicted to these powerful drugs. It's important that society has some standards and guides for wellbeing of individuals. There really is no argument that illicit drugs are beneficial for one. Legalizing them is an admission of utter defeat, not a measure for benefiting anyone or admitting that illicit drugs are not harmful, that society was mistaken about the harm they cause."264,"Abortion should be a choice for rape victims, incest victims, and health to the mother.  Now there will be more females getting illegal abortions which could be dangerous.  A 13 year old should not be forced to carry a child if they were raped.  Or any female for that matter. If the mother has health issues that could kill her having a child that should be a choice.  There will be so many more people that will be in the system because they can not afford a child. I remember the pain of being pregnant and giving birth.  I don't think anyone should be forced to go through that if it is not wanted.   I do think there should be a term limit though."274,I believe abortion shouldn't be the subject of the court or law at all. Abortion is medical care and should be protected like all other privacy issues. It should be between a woman and her doctor. Period. To use a religious/Christian dogma to determine an individual woman's medical decisions is dangerous. Church/State separate in all things.278,"I write for a vaccine mandate since Covid was a severe issue that took many, many lives of the young, old, and the middle with hospitals being filled with patients. It was terrible, too many deaths could have been prevented if somehow the mandate was sooner and more in supply. people were against it despite the high number of deaths, it was saddening to see how many people have passed away."279,"I've known people to get severely injured, harassed, and even lose their life in the pursuit of a safe termination to their pregnancy. Abortion NEEDS to be accessible."296,"The issue I would choose to talk about is the legalization of illicit substances as it is the topic I am most familiar with and a topic that I have written papers on before. The first point of discussion is that the general sentiment towards the legalization of certain licit substances is only a matter of time. On the state level there are many states that are reforming their drug policy much to the benefit of their communities, the people living in these communities, and the police in charge of protecting these communities. Marijuana for example which is still a schedule one drug federally has been introduced for both medical and recreational use. In the states that have legalized Marijuana for medical and recreational use teen drug usage has decreased. While community outreach and other social and health service programs have been established with the tax revue generated from the sale of Marijuana. This is just one example of the many different licit substances that could be legalized for both recreational or medical use to provide benefits to the community. Rather then fund the illegal usage and selling of these substances by criminal elements that line their own pocket and put the health and safety of the community at risk as seen with the increase of fentanyl deaths happening as of recent."298,"I've been a proponent for drug legalization for decades... long before legalizing marijuana gained any traction in general conversations! The funny thing is that I don't do drugs. Still, humans have been finding ways to get high and escape life for a little while since the first fig fermented, so why not a) make it safe, b) make it quality controlled for safety, c) provide specific places it's legal, and d) tax it like any other business to help our communities and states.

While we're at it - sex work should also be legalized, regulated, and taxed. These are things that people have always done and will ALWAYS do. The puritanical right refuses to accept these truths of humanity. Thus we have overflowing prisons, crime, and abused people of all types."308,"I do not believe in affirmative action. I believe that the most qualified students should be rewarded for the hard work, good grades etc. Letting a certain number of individuals into college or work because they are black is a scary thing. Some of these people may not be qualified to do the job. They got in on their skin color not their skill. Whether white or black or any color this should scare everyone. Giving someone something special because of their skin color is called racism. Why do we think this is okay for blacks but blacks cry racism if they think whites are getting the privileges? I know many white people who are underprivileged as well and can barely pay their bills. They aren't getting any special favors. To act like whites have it made and don't suffer is outrageous. Some of the richest people on earth are black."315,"I think affirmative action helps people, it gives minorities a chance and makes things not based on nepotism."316,"I am anti-abortion because I truly believe abortion is murder. Abortion is the intentional killing of another human being who is not yet born (a fetus). Abortion is not healthcare. People who argue that they should not have to carry a fetus are neglecting two things: 1. that fetus is a child (not a clump of cells) and 2. they did the action to create the child. People should be held accountable for their own decisions. Others may claim that there should be exceptions in the case of rape or the life of the mother. I have two things to say about this. In regards to rape, two wrongs do not make a right. I am sorry to people who were raped, and I hope the perpetrator is brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. However, you cannot choose to murder someone else. That child is innocent and deserves a chance at life. Second, in the case of the mother's health (not mental health but true dire physical health), this situation is not classified as abortion. People have not done their research because terminating a life to save the life of the mother is not classified as abortion. Now there are situations like Chrissy Teigen brought up where they killed their child because ""the child would not survive outside of the womb."" This does not affect her health at all. I believe in miracles, and this was truly evil."318,Covid vaccines sshould be mandatory its all about keeping people safe. People need to stop crying. Biden is doing a great job Trump did horrible.322,"I will write about my position on abortion. i strongly support abortion and am pro-choice. Why i hold this view is because a clump of cells inside a person's organs is not a human, but a person who is able to get pregnant IS a human. By making abortion illegal, you are taking away bodily autonomy from humans and commiting a human rights violation and an act of war. It is morally inhumane to force people to conveice and bear children. Not only does it harm the people forced to have children, but it harms everybody involved, including the children. Making abortion illegal will result in endless tragedies and horrors, including people dying from trying to perform them illegally because by making them illegal you make them unsafe and dangerous. Abortions will NOT stop occuring, they will only become unsafe and result in countless fatalities and injuries and suffering. It will also criminilize people who have had to make one of the hardest decisions of their life. Nobody wants to have to go through abortion. This process is already painful enough for a person to go through, criminlizing them for it is unbelivably inhumane it astounds me anybody could possibly support making abortion illegal. 

Making it illegal would also result in a drastic increase of unwanted children being born, which would then both put a heavy strain on the already flawed foster care system, as well as result in increase in child abuse and neglect in the homes of parents who cannot care for their unwanted children. Abuse, including sexual abuse, is extremely common in foster homes, so there would be an increase in all of that as well, causing an increase in severe trauma related illness in kids and mental health problems. I coud honestly go on about this for hours, but i'll stop here because i've already said quite a bit. I feel very strongly about this issue and the right to abortion and bodily autonomy. 

Legal abortions protect everybody. Fetuses aren't humans, people who can get pregnant ARE hu"323,"I do not believe in defunding the police. They are there to serve and protect society. They put their life on the line every day to make sure that law abiding citizens can live their lives safely. As in any organization, there maybe few bad apples but you do not throw out the baby with the bathwater."324,"I feel that abortion should be legalized because it's a woman's right to have control over her own body. To no allow a woman choices over her own body is insane to think about and it's even more insane that Roe Vs Wade was actually overturned. Taking away abortions is not going to help anymore, it will help to more issues in the long term. I heard a politician talk about abortions' and he said under any circumstance an abortion should be illegal, even if the woman is raped. He also said they are planning to push for abortion to be illegal under all circumstances. It made me very angry and frustrated to hear that because something that is force upon a woman and than leads to consequences is morally wrong. A woman deserves the right to decide if she keeps a baby or not. I think more unwanted children will start filling up foster care and orphanages. These children will have life long issues from the shift of being placed into multiple different foster homes if they are not adopted into a loving family."333,I believe the police need to be defended to a certain degree. Most Law enforcement offices have military grade equipment and that is unneeded. That is where I hold my position on the matter.346,"I'll write about vaccine mandates. I am completely against mandates. There is no pandemic that causes a major threat to human life nor has there been since the idea of ""vaccine mandates"" became a reality. There also doesn't seem to be any contagious disease on the horizon that threatens life on a mass scale. Lastly, the government has no right to insist that any human undergo a medical treatment. When such a basic right as one's own body is taken away from a person, that is a violation of their most fundamental right, and all other rights are at risk for government control. A perfect example for all of the above is the mandates that were put in place for COVID-19, mandating untested, ineffective, potentially lethal vaccines that only served to deprive people of their jobs, their livelihoods, their recreation, including travel and entertainment, and promoted social division."347,"The abortion issue is a philosophically dense one. Depending on who you're talking to, it can divulge into hours long conversations about the ontology of human life and existence in general. Under our current philosophical framework in the west, it's my opinion that it's illogical to maintain that abortion should be legalized. This raises another point. Asking whether abortion should be LEGALIZED isn't equivalent to asking whether abortion is MORAL. 

I'll answer the question as to why I think abortion shouldn't be legalized. Let's start with some axioms we generally believe here in the west. Unprovoked homicide ought to be avoided. In other words, killing another human isn't acceptable without an amalgam of factors proving it's justification. So why then, should a woman be allowed to terminate the human life developing in her womb. Perhaps it's not a human life. Why? What defines a human life? What I've found is that any arbitrary line you attempt to draw which demarcates ""human life"", can very simply be disproven by a counterexample which we would all agree is definitely human life. The only logically consistent basis I've come to reason with, is conception. At conception an entirely unique genetic code is formed form the unique synthesis of the egg and sperm. Barring few exceptions, it's my belief that we ought to uphold the rights of that life."357,"vaccination should be mandatory in all senses, if this had been implemented a long time ago, perhaps there would be no pandemics like the current one because we would develop a body immune to certain diseases"361,"I believe in legalizing illicit substances. The War on Drugs not only failed in its mission, but prevented many substances with possible medical uses from being explored. Its only success has been putting thousands of non-violent offenders in prison for the crime of... doing something to themselves? The government can stay out of our personal lives. If someone is not infringing on another's constitutional or civil rights, the government has no right to impose its morals upon that citizen."364,"Vaccines should be mandatory. That way, there can't be any gray area with regards to getting them, and this damned pandemic would have been over already if idiots would just get on board. So sick of the disinformation campaign from these toolbags screaming about computer chips and Bill Gates and 5G... Dude. If you won't voluntarily help your fellow humans, then maybe you need to be forced into it. Because I really don't know how to explain to you that A. you need to care about other people, and B. you've been grossly misinformed. P.S. You're in a cult."366,Defunding the police is a poorly worded tagline. We need to reallocate funds to mental health services. We need to lift people out of poverty. Reallocate funds to update our school environments. Give training to the police to non-violent escalation. Too much money is used to militarize our police force but little training in how to deal with actual people of the community. The police are getting off the hook to easily with murder and there is a culture of violence that needs to be examined before we continue flooding them with money.367,"I will choose the topic of legalizing all illicit drugs since that is the way the question was framed. First, I dont believe all drugs have the potential for the same harm and should not be all classified the same under the law. Many people are incarcerated for possession of an illicit substance, for example marijuana, and are then introduced into the prison system. These same people are then more likely to commit other offenses and be re-incarcerated. They are discriminated against when exiting prison and have difficulty establishing a working life. Everything is much harder for people who have been imprisoned and when the reason for their imprisonment is something that should not be a crime the fact is more egregious.
There should be different penalties for possession vs intent to sell, which there is already established, but not always enforced fairly. There are some drugs that I do not believe should be legalized as they are far too dangerous to society. They destroy families and an individual's health and ambitions. They are most often addictive in nature and most humans have a huge mountain of difficulty in freeing themselves from addiction, a reality which affects a person's entire life span and can negatively impact generations of people surrounding that individual. Legalization of illicit substances like opiates creates a class who is addictive and is unproductive, people who then turn to crime to support their addictive habit. Legalization of other types of drugs could mean many more people traffic the substances making them much more available to society at every age level. The idea is destructive to society, endangering the lives of children and others who arent well educated on the subject or have mental/emotional problems, seek escape or suicide."373,"I feel very strongly about the removal of standardized testing because nobody on this planet is standardized--especially not people with any kind of learning or developmental disability. We are so focused, in American schools, on memorization and drilling for tests that we tend to learn very little. School should be about learning, not about preparing for tests or gaining credits. There are few occupations where you are expected to have all of your information memorized, and are not allowed to keep notes, check ""the book,"" or ask others for help, so we should focus our schooling on HOW to learn; how to take notes; how to check your references. The results of other countries following this method speaks for itself."377,"I do not believe that illicit drugs should be legalized.  They are dangerous, costly, make it more difficult for a person to hold a job and interferes with raising a family or being a part of the family.  It also increases the likely hood for criminal behaviour, and the jails are overcrowded now.  The chances of someone who uses illicit drugs becoming a productive member of society are reduced, and I believe illicit drugs are bad for your health and can lead to premature death"379,"I believe that abortion should not be legal. Every single baby that is aborted is a human. It doesn't matter that they are in a very early stage of developing, they are still a human just as infants, toddlers and children are different phases of development. No matter what the situation, it is not the babies fault that they were conceived. You cant deny that they already have been conceived so they deserve the right to live life."381,"After the supreme court ruled on abortion being the rights of the states, I as a gay married man fear that my marriage will soon no longer be recognized and invalidated next.  All because of some conservative politicians and their voters do not agree with my lifestyle.  They are using their religious reasons to hide behind their hate, as well as manipulating their constituents into voting for them.  They are power hungry and do not care about anything other than votes, power, and money. They are using God as tool for their greed and lust for piety, all while preaching to others about how to be righteous and God fearing.

I personally do not agree with abortion myself (unless medically necessary), but I agree with it being the right of women to chose to have an abortion or not.  I have never met someone who wanted an abortion, but I have met many women who are not prepared mentally, financially, or who have no support system at all other than welfare programs to help them raise the child.  The problem is that these pious politicians and their voters stop caring about that child once the child is born and then attack the mother's dependence on welfare programs and possibly criminal activity as a means to keep their voter's in a hate fueled cycle that never ends.  They say that they have no plans to attack marriage equality or interracial marriage, but it is just a matter of time until they need more votes to remain in power and thus attacking"386,"Mandatory vaccinations has become a travesty, in my opinion. Especially where covid=19 is concerned. They say to go with the science, the evidence. Yet, the evidence clearly outweighs the reasons that the vaccines are a positive thing in this instance. There are more deaths and adverse reactions happening still daily. The statistics showing the lives that are being saved are ridiculously low compared to the data showing they are doing more harm. When any of this is mentioned, we are made to look like fools-rebel non-vaxxers who are Trump supporters and treasonous terrorists who just want to be famous on social media. That is not who I am. I am someone who thinks logically before allowing my family any harm. I am not distrusting so much as one who likes to do her own due diligence regarding matters of importance. I am definitely someone who opposes anyone or thing that demands me to do something I do not want to do. I have done in depth research regarding this topic and regardless of how I personally feel towards the topic, I have to consider everything that is available to me and would rather (much rather in this instance) be wrong and apologize than see my findings be the cause for any harm being done to anyone. 
Fact is, everywhere I look, there is more evidence opposing that of what is being shown on MSM. It is obvious to me that there is criminal sabotage going on in places that should be protecting our citizens to the level of treason I would never have considered possible, even in a book of fiction previously. 
I am constantly reminded of the old saying: if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, and walks like a duck... It obviously isn't an eagle"395,"Although I understand the argument behind affirmative action and am sympathetic to the sentiments behind it, I am nonetheless against the practice. First, as far as I know, affirmative action is a practice that has largely been implemented to level the playing field vis-a-vis the axis of race and to a lesser degree gender. Yet inequality exists along many other axes like sexuality, socioeconomic class, immigration status, and so on.  I think that society should help all those who face inequality and injustice, but the difficult part is how to spread the resources among those groups. I think affirmative action bestows a privilege on certain groups at the expense of other marginalized groups, and in doing so, it creates a tremendous amount of resentment. Second, I think that the fundamental problem in society is not that marginalized groups are not able to get into college as compared to other groups. Instead, the real problem is the poverty and mediocre education systems within the communities of the marginalized groups.  In my opinion, affirmative action is like giving a person a life vest to a person whose home floods twice a month. It's helpful, but the life vest does nothing to address the flooding. In the end, I do not support affirmative action because I think it's unfair to other marginalized groups, does not address the fundamental problem, and creates a tremendous amount of resentment within society."396,"I think that defunding the police is something is something that the name of it is not what it is intended to be. Defunding the police means taking some funding from the police to fund mental health specialists, crisis counselors, etc , sending these people out on calls of people having a mental health crisis or drug issue would be better than police alone who do not have much if any training to handle these types of situations. In the long run it would help get more people care they need instead of getting shot or arrested and spending time in jail instead of getting help."411,I think abortion should be legal because it gives more liberty and choice for their health.420,"I believe all vaccines should be mandatory if humanly possible, no religious exceptions allowed. Why should we have anyone suffer from a disease or illness if they shouldn't have to? Do we really want a fellow human being to be miserable or die? No one should be that selfish. The line about vaccines giving autism has been already been disproved.  The more people that are healthy and don't die from needless illness or diseases the better. Because of moronic antivaxxers, we now have diseases coming back that we had eradicated prior."424,I am for legalizing most drugs because then they can be made safer for usage. Most of them can also be used for good rather bad. Like they can be used for therapy. It helps put less people in jail who wanted to escape reality for little bit. Many of them are safer than alcohol and need to less crime too. I want to help others than criminalize them.427,"I believe that if illicit drugs are legalized, greater opportunities and possibilities for academic research will be available, and more complex treatment programs will be developed.  The criminalization of psychedelic drugs stunted clinical research for decades, and such drugs are now becoming popularly referenced as powerful therapeutics.  The mind is much more complex than any drug, but psychedelics oftentimes trigger a revolutionary change in outlook after a single use.  I believe psychedelics should be legalized though controlled by licensed professionals, like many other medications."428,"Abortion should be legalized (again) for a multitude of reasons. However, spending time listing those many reasons is entirely unnecessary. A sufficient argument for the legalization of abortions is that women have the right to bodily autonomy. This is where the conversation should begin and end. Another reason for this legalization is that the US is contradicting its founding principles by allowing religious zealots to impose their views on an entire country. Church and state have never been truly separated in the US, but recent developments have highlighted this issue."429,"I believe abortion should be legal because on the most basic level it is an element of an individual's right to life, liberty, and happiness. Additionally, there is no counterargument that upholds the separation of church and state. Abortion is a form of medical care that allows pregnant individuals to avoid the physical tolls (including death and serious injury), mental tolls (including trauma from being forced to give birth/remain pregnant after rape or incest), and financial tolls from pregnancy due to the USA's failure of a healthcare system."441,"I believe that women should have access to abortions because making them illegal accomplishes nothing. It will not prevent women from abortions, it will just prevent them from having legal abortions. This means that women will have to undergo abortions that are not in a medical setting, which is dangerous. People forget that women can be raped or lied to about contraception, which means that it is not their choice or fault for being pregnant. They also forget that there are complications to pregnancy that can cause birth to kill the mother. It does not make sense that people wanting to prevent abortion say they care about the child, because they give no consideration to whether the women giving birth. They also don't consider that when people have children they don't want, these children often do not end up having good lives."444,"I am strongly in favor of keeping abortion safe and legal because people who are able to become pregnant should have absolute say over whether they bear a child or not. Carrying a pregnancy has enormous health, economic and emotional implications and the person bearing the child should have final say over this life-altering choice. This doesn't even begin to touch on external circumstances that would make abortion an otherwise logical choice, such as rape, incest, pregnancy of a minor, or the health and life of the mother and/or fetus at stake. Pregnancy may be common but it doesn't make it any less dangerous or life-changing in ways that those who cannot get pregnant can viscerally understand."449,Abortion should be legal because it is healthcare.450,"While I scored very well on standardized tests and even received scholarships because of them, I believe they have reached the end of their previous benefits. Many incredibly bright students struggle with performance anxiety during tests. This inability to perform, whether due to a learning disability or the mental hold of anxiety, has the ability to literally end an educational career. For instance, a student with exceptional grades and extra curricular activities may not have a test score that accurately shows their skill OR drive. This could result in loss of scholarships that would have afforded an opportunity at higher education. Instead that may go to someone like me, a person who performed well and scored high, but ultimately left school before the end of senior year because frankly, I didn't know what I wanted in my life. Everyone deserves a chance at greatness."464,"The decriminalization of illicit drugs should take place in a manner that aids convicted persons who were incarcerated for minor uses of opioids, while still ensuring that such drugs are prescribed in a safe manner to prevent abuse and overuse. Decriminalization will enable those dependent on drugs to be able to obtain these drugs in a safe manner, rather than depend on black market trades and dealers who may supply dangerous drugs with wrong dosages or other more dangerous substances such as fentanyl.

Decriminalization will also allow authorities to redirect resources towards other crime that may benefit the public more. In addition, decriminalization enables doctors and other health professionals to take on the role of ensuring that illicit drug users are able to manage addiction, use, and recovery in a safe manner without the user fearing retribution and penalties."471,"I think drugs should be legalized because people will do drugs no matter what.  If they are legalized, then the drugs that people buy are safer than what can be bought on the street.  I also think legalized drugs have a lot less of a taboo that illegal drugs, so that should make them less desirable.  Legalizing drugs should also reduce criminal organizations whose main function is to produce and smuggle drugs.  Drug cartels are incredibly violent, so hopefully legalizing drugs would reduce this violence."480,"I am very against the banning of abortion. As a woman, this issue makes me physically ill to think about. It depresses me. It really feels unreal that a supreme court decision, that was the model case to look back on when examining similar cases, could be so quickly and easily overturned. Its shocking that anyome thinks they should be able to dictate how another person lives their life. I feel so disappointed in humanity, though i do know there are many people who feeel the same as i do. I didnt really have any faith in government before this happened, but my fear of the gov't has grown exponentially. Who knows what rights they will come for, and ultimately take away next?"487,Vaccines should be mandated in certain circumstances. In circumstances where you work with the immuno compromised and children. A child shouldn't be sent to school to spread disease. They are sent to learn. Patients aren't sent to the hospital to die because of a nurse. They are there for help. It is common sense.489,The police should not be defended because there is no viable substitute that exists. If someone calls 911 that person expects a competent individual to respond. That person needs to be trained to act appropriately.  The police have received such training. Until we are assured that  a replacement force has adequate training we should still rely on the police.499,Government has no business at all in deciding issues of abortion. Completely a non-political matter. A few republican judges should not be deciding whether or not women can have abortions. Stay out of it.500,"I think that affirmative action is important in our society because our society is still not a meritocracy, even though we claim it is. Due to historic disadvantages of certain groups, other groups have had the chance to advance in terms of work, employment, health, housing, and other similar areas--often at the expense of the historically oppressed group. Affirmative action helps create a better platform from which we can attempt to reach equality.

I've seen this firsthand, and often feel that I've just been fortunate enough to be born as someone of a somewhat ambiguous race, who is not easily categorized."504,"I oppose affirmative action for the most part because it just seems unfair in merit based areas. These places were originally created to take the best of the best (like college admissions), but AA just circumvents this for social issues. That leads to substandard candidates and ruins the lives of more qualified people. Many AA candidates struggle to even graduate, which makes this worse."506,"Affirmative action - I chose this because I am non-white. With this, I get a fair share in employment and other opportunities that would have otherwise open only to whites."514,"I believe drugs should be legal.  Other countries have tried similar programs and overall usage went down.  It is easier for people to seek treatment for addiction, treatments for depression can be made available to sufferers, and the incarceration rate can be reduced.  There are too many people in prison for small drug crimes, and keeping that many people in the prison system hurts society overall.

Crime would be reduced, and drug clinics can save lives instead of someone getting last-minute treatment from an EMT.  This would also take power and influence away from cartels.  I hold this position because dealing with it the usual way damages lives."515,"I am 64 years old and although affirmative action was not applied to Asian students (many people do not know this), I was admitted to Cornell and NYU Law School despite lower SAT and LSAT scores, because I came from the inner city of Los Angeles and did quite well for someone from a lower income family.  I always worked at least 20 hours a week since I was 15 and still got excellent grades.  I went on to work in a Wall Street firm.

Colleges are a place for student to grow and learn in the free exchange of ideas.  Most students in the late 70's had no idea about my life and my values and the trials that my family has faced in the US.  We were able to learn from each other.  

SATs and GPAs are not the only indicators of how students will contribute on compus and whether they will be successful in life and successful at college.  

Finally, Asians are now often discriminated in admissions, because Ivy League schools are looking to have diverse classes.  I don't think that white people understand that Harvard could by 85% Asian without affirmative action and other programs that look at a broad range on factors in admission."517,"I'm going to go with abortion.

I'm neutral to slightly against abortion.

I believe life is extremely valuable.

It's a silly thing but the odds of our parents meeting and producing us, of their parents meeting and producing them, and on and on for generations are just so incredibly small.

In some cases I think it's understandable but when someone wants to have an abortion because they made a mistake and it would inconvenience them I'm not so sure it should be legal.

But it's a very complicated issue and I'm OK with whatever we vote for."522,"Police Departments have way too high a budget in my city. They get paid way too much to only solve a small percent of crimes. They do not need state of the art military equipment to use against civilians. Defunding the police is like putting a bandaid on a bullet hole. The entire system can burn to the ground for all I care. The rampant corruption is reason enough to disband the entire thing. Bunch of touchy psychopaths allowed in our streets with guns, tasers, and hand cuffs? No thanks. I wouldn’t even feel this way if they were ever held accountable for their misdeeds, but no, they deny any wrong doing. If accountability is out the window, take their money. They WASTE money in my city."524,"I am deeply passionate about the right to safe abortions because I am a woman who accidentally got pregnant at a young age and there was a law that prevented me from getting an abortion. I had an abusive partner who was an alcoholic drug addict (he was also cheating on me). I lost my job and couldn't work because I had ""morning sickness"" for 5 months. I was forced to bring a child into a broken home and ended up losing custody on accident when I signed paperwork for him to be on his father's parents' insurance plan, which was and is still very traumatic. My illnesses (endometriosis, adenomyosis) got worse and my overall well-being and quality of life diminished. I am still living in poverty and a lot of the opportunities I had to work and go to college were stripped away from me. 

Since men have the choice to put their penis inside women, women should also have the choice to abort a cluster of cells that will eventually grow into a living behing that has astronomical financial, emotional, and physical needs, often forcing them to be a single parent and rely on things like WIC, food stamps, welfare, etc. The choice of whether or not to give birth soley relies on the man with a penis. If he kept his penis out of a woman, there would be no chance of her getting pregnant.

In addition to that, many women are raped and are forced to give birth. Who would want to grow up knowing that they were the result of a life-long traumatic experience? Women who are raped should not be forced to give birth - they should have the option to abort. Especially things like incestual rape, which will result in a human being with disabilities due to the incest. Not only that, but the child will grow up knowing that they were conceived in a disgusting and disturbing way.

Another issue is that there are women who cannot have babies due to their health, and there have been many mothers who have died during childbirth. Eptopic pregnancies are life-threatening and yet abortions being illegal m"525,"Standardized testing is not the end all to college admissions, as GPA is often more consistent for a future look into a student's performance at school. ACT and SAT are not consistent in the categories of testing, where the pre-test review materials often not line up with the actual contents of the test, making the preparation meaningless and only increase student stress. These high school graduates should be able to prove themselves with just a history of what they did in school and the GPA instead of these arbitrary test-them-all thing that isn't representative of what is to come in the college experience."529,"I strongly support keeping affirmative action. The inputs in selection processes are biased, so affirmative action overcomes this."531,"MANDATORY VACCINES SHOULD BE MADE MANDATORY BECAUSE NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE MYSELF OR MY CHILD SICK. 
STANDERIZED TESTING SHOULD BE BANNED BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE ENOJGH TOIN WORRY ABOUT DURING THEIR SENIOR YEAR, LIKE WHAT COLLEGE AND IF THEY WILL GET ANY LOANS FOR COLLEGE. THESE TESTS DO NOT SHOW WHAT THE STUDENT IS TRULY LEARNING. TEACHERS WORRY ABOUT NOT GETTING MONEY FOR THEIR SCHOOLS SO THEY TEACH TO TEST.
AFFIRTMATIVE ACTION SHOULD BE ABOLISHED BECAUSE IT IS PROMOTING MINORITIES TO POSITIONS THEY ARE NOT READY FOR."532,"I support vaccine mandates because they are a matter of public, rather than private health. The purposes of a vaccine are not only to protect the individual, but reduce the burden on the health care system and, more importantly, reduce the illnesses ability to spread. If enough of a population is partially or completely immune, an infectious illness will not be able to spread very far, and will be able to be contained. This is how diseases are controlled and eradicated - they require population level solutions, and thus population level compliance. If the population is not willing to do so without a mandate, then a mandate should be used - the same as we have used it for years for other illnesses that can result in harm if they spread. We also mandate illness where contagiousness is not a factor because we understand that children should be protected from disease, in general."534,"i don't believe in affirmative action because  it creates an unfair advantage for people who are possibly undeserving. tests and applications and job advancement should be gender BLIND, race BLIND, and sexuality BLIND to make hiring/advancement a fair process."536,I am strongly opposed to making abortion illegal because abortion is health care and is not a moral issue. It should not be decided by politicians who do not have the medical knowledge or experience to make medical decisions. It should be a matter that is only between the pregnant person and their healthcare provider. Making abortion illegal is just an attempt to strip women of their rights and dignity.543,I think that for too long woman and minorities have been getting jobs and spots in collegs that they do not deserve.  I would not want to get a job or into a college because of my gender or race. I want to get in because i deserve it.  If I cannot lift a 100 pound dead weight dummy out of a burning car I should not get into the state patrol because they have to hire so many women. I should have to be able to do the same job as the men.  If I have a lower gpa I should not get the spot in a college over a guy just because of affirmative action.  That is sexist.548,"I think we should legalize drugs. Mostly, I don't believe the state should be trying to control the behavior of adults. Let people do as they will and suffer the consequences. Also, I take issue with civil forfeiture laws, which are often abused to try to take property and have been quite lucrative for the state even though claims of the property being used in drug crime are often tenuous. I can see where there could be other advantages like allowing people to seek medical care or addiction help without such stigma, allowing people with chronic pain access to meds that will help (I hear a lot of people on long-term prescriptions for pain are having a lot of trouble with doctors no longer willing to prescribe due to the opioid crisis), removing a barrier that keeps a segment of the population from being able to obtain employment, and depriving gangs and cartels of a good chunk of their income."558,"The police defunding issue is a great microcosm of American politics at this point. There are certainly more than two factions but there are two relevant factions that have a lot of influence, one of which (more left than liberal) tends to desire removing systems without that much thought of how it works, why it's there, or what to replace it with (the liberal side of the liberal/left alliance will tend to think more about what to replace it with, but that replacement is generally obvious, not new, and previously failed). The right/populist faction tends to support traditions whether they understand them or not (distribution is oddly random), though they're united by the Chesterton's Fence tradition that you should understand something before you try to remove or replace it. We certainly do have specific experiences we can use to guide us, of place without law enforcement or with ineffective law enforcement (from Somalia to Seattle's Summer of Love and the streets of San Francisco and many more). From these experiences we have very little to recommend these policies. There is certainly *much* to be reformed in policing as with many systems (every human system is subject to corruption), and the first part of any attempt I would recommend is transparency - the more we know about these systems and their failing, the better we can design our reforms (and abusers in the system and failed reformers outside it have little incentive to make sure this information is available)."559,"I think that standardized testing should be removed from the schooling system. Standardized tests are not the correct way to show a student's full potential, and it causes students to have increased anxiety."560,I am against abortion. I don’t think anyone has the right to kill another human being. That life has no voice. They have a right to live.561,"I believe that abortion should not be illegal. I think that there should be some restrictions on it, which Roe v. Wade established. I honestly fully look at this issue separate from my moral beliefs, because I think that the law and morality should be separate. The government of the United States is meant to be kept separate from religion. Being that I do not believe that a fetus is necessarily a human being until the purpose that it can survive on its own, I think that the decision to carry the baby or not is within the mother's medical privacy. It is honestly better to allow them to be legalized within reason as the odds are that mothers would find a way to do it for themselves or have crack pot doctors do it for them. Additionally, there are so many children who are already alive that are in or need to be in foster care that it would be unreasonable to spend our time fighting to keep babies alive so that they can end up even further overextending the system. We need to think about the whole picture to a certain extent. While there is a point where the baby should be prioritized, I believe that there is a time within the pregnancy that the mother should be able to choose. The outline set forth in Roe v. Wade was very reasonable and I think it should have been kept."565,Abortion is wrong. It is murder. Women have birth control or the option to keep their legs closed. We have thousands if not millions of couples who would love to adopt children. Women have to stop using abortion as  birth control. If someone shoots a pregnant woman they are charge with two counts of murder because it is murder to kill the unborn. You cannot have both ways. It is not your body it is actually a whole separate body. People have to accept responsibility for their actions. Abortion use to be not such a big issue but the left had to take it to the extreme like everything else. Now they want to murder the babies up until the time of birth and even up to 24 days after. It is disgusting and it has to stop.566,"Defunding the police
 Can you imagine our cousin there were no police? People that do follow the law would be too scared to leave their homes. People would be beaten or murdered without any consequences.children and women would be raped. Slavery would probably come back, and this time anyone weaker would be a slave. It is unthinkable what would happen to our country if there were no police."568,"By affirmative action was designed to help reduce racism, which isn't actually fixed by rules.  Though it has done a good job of bringing equality to the forefront, these stipulations are no longer required.  People have grown to understand these ideals and do not need to be forced into choices, but left to choose among those best qualified, without the constant criticism of equality."573,"When I was younger, the liberal media's position on abortion was the only one I heard. Being young, female, and selfish, I took it for granted that I had a right to control my own body, yadda yadda.

Then I became a parent, and slowly, over a period of years, my attitude changed. I marveled, as every parent does, over my baby's development. She started out as a lump that ate and cried and slept and pooped. Over time she rolled over, sat up, cut teeth, learned to understand what was being said to her--she turned into a little person with a personality all her own. It unfolded like a miraculous computer program, all by itself, or rather she did it all by herself. I shoveled it in one end and shoveled it away from the other, but it was all her doing the miracle. I would look at my little girl's head and think about all the potential locked up inside there, waiting to come out. Just think--everything she'll ever be is already in there! And if it's in there now, it was already in there the day she was born, and the day before that, and the day before that...and there is no point at which you can arbitrarily draw a line and say it's ok to kill this person  on this day of gestation but not on the next day. It's your DNA that makes you human and she had that from the moment of conception.
And I'm also a Christian and it's a biblical principal that we are to treat others in the way that is most beneficial to them, not according to our own agenda. Imagine if the abortion debate took up that concept. Insisting that you have a right to kill an unborn baby because you don't want to be bothered with it is profoundly selfish and it's a sad commentary on our society that so many people think selfishness is entirely justifiable."579,"The issue I choose to write about is affirmative action being dissolved. I completely support affirmative action being dissolved 100%. While I don't think that affirmative action should have never been enacted, I believe that it has done it's job and is way overdue to be ended. I believe that during the years where integration of the races was still new, affirmative action was needed to make it so that racist hiring managers could not always choose the white (or other race) applicant over the black applicant. Racism was rampant in those years, and I believe this was started in good faith by politicians to help a race that was starting very behind the finish line. But it is now 2022, and the world is a completely different place than it was 60-70 years ago. Whites are now on pace to be the minority in the US, so why in the world do we still need affirmative action? If anything, we should start talking about affirmative action for whites! But people would blow their gaskets if that was suggested. We do not have racism as we did in the past, it is now time to make a fair playing field for all races to be hired based solely on their qualifications and ability to do the job. Not only is that fair, but think about a position like a fireman or a surgeon. Would you rather have your black surgeon have been hired over a much more qualified white surgeon simply because he was black? I would want the most qualified surgeon hired to be holding my life in his hands, I don't care what his race is."581,"I think all women should have the right to choose what to do with their own body. Everyone makes mistakes, and not everyone is able to take care of children with their circumstances. I don't think we should force women to have children, we should allow them to have an abortion if they so choose. I hold this belief because I've seen too many women who are not able to take of their own children and neglect them because they didn't want to have children in the first place."583,"I'm for the legalization of certain drugs but not all illicit drugs because I think people should be free to put whatever they want in their bodies as long as they aren't hurting anyone else. Personally I find drug users of all kinds to be dumb for even trying it in the first place but if they want to do it why should I stop them? Alcohol is legal and arguably worse than marijuana, if I didn't use it for cooking I would never buy it myself. It's either ban alcohol or make the lesser drugs legal in my opinion"584,I dont believe the vaccine should be mandatory. Even though I got it I dont believe they should force people to do something they dont want to do. Its against everything we believe in. The vaccine doesnt prevent covid it just makes it less worse when you get it.589,"I believe abortion not only destroys the life of a baby human, but also the life of the mother and father who choose to terminate the baby’s life. Contrary to what is proclaimed, the women who aborts her baby carry’s that with her for the rest of her life. Choosing to give birth and care for the child or put the baby up for adoption is a selfless act which will lead to a more tender compassionate heart."591,Legalizing all drugs is a terrible idea. It would be like San Francisco everywhere. Junkies shambling about like the walking dead.594,Legalization of drugs is costly for treatment for our govt. People should be using so it should not be legal.604,"Drugs should NOT be legalized in any way. People are too irresponsable to use it wisely and as a result, innocent people will be killed buy the actions of the users. That being said, however, someone suffering with a painful, terminal  disease may get relief using legal medical marajuana."611,"As a Christian, I believe abortion should be legal. This is a healthcare choice and should not be treated as a public policy issue. Women choose abortion for many reasons and as long as it's early enough & safe then it shouldn't be illegal. As for the religious aspect: God told us not to judge others, they will have to answer for the choices they make in life and it's no one else's business nor right to force their own version of morality onto others."615,"I firmly believe that standardized testing is needed. We should be judged at merit, not equality of outcome. When I was in school standardized testing was a major motivation for me to strive to be better, to learn more, to compete. I think true fairness comes from your abilities, not equality of outcome. If I work and study hard, that should be a major factor in me getting hired, not the color of my skin. I believe for most people in America, if you work hard you can succeed."616,"I believe in limiting abortions but not totally abolishing.  Abortions should not be used as a form of birth control.  Victims of rape and incest should be allowed to abort.  Also, if baby has defect or mom is unwell should be allowed. In my view as a Christian life is precious.  Use protection when you have sex, it is free at clinics."624,"I believe that the police should NOT be defunded, and that it shouldn't ever be a thought in our minds. If you look at how crime has increased in the past few years, how can anyone be prepared for what would happen if police were to be defunded, if they were no longer around to call on when you need help? They wouldn't be around to intervene in disputes, which they often do, and deescalate the situation, preventing violence and death. There'd be no police to call when a person's child is kidnapped. There would be no investigation. No criminal found. No justice. No one to stop rapes, murders, hate crimes, theft, the list goes on and on. It would turn into anarchy in this country. We would truly suffer if this were to ever happen."627,"i'm against vaccine mandates. if a person wants the vaccine, then take it. if they do not want the vaccine, then they should have to take it. mandating something builds animosity and promotes disunity. in addition, the vaccines are fairly useless and only target a previous vaccine strain. natural immunity would build stronger and natural immune systems and help build confidence in a person, which would build stronger mental health."631,If you have to put someone else down in order to lift yourself up then it is a false lift.644,Drugs should not be legalized because I've seen first hand how it always destroys the life of the people doing drugs alongside the lives of all the people that love them not to mention the lives of the people that they rob rape and kill for said drugs647,"Standardized testing brings light to areas of the curriculum that are lacking, and can be used to formulate education plans for improvement in those areas. For example, if standardized tests within a school showed that the average test results in math were below grade level, this is helpful for that school to know they need to improve their math curriculum and teaching."649,I believe that the police should not be defunded. It is a public service vital to our society. Without funding the police we will have less protection.654,"I am totally against the de-funding of any police force in America. Mu opinion such actions will increase the level of crimes in our communities, prevent emergency services when needed, provide no support during shooting and terrorist incidents, and cause high turnover rates in police forces."655,"Vaccine mandates are terrible , but you have a communist government right now saying you must get the vaccine ohh really what about all the illegals coming over the border not one word about them getting a vaccine why is that??? But your forcing American citizens, military to get mandatory shots but yet they say everyone has the right to a abortion this government is beyond repair you have a Brian dead president who is shoved papers in front of him to read and has no clue what's he is saying.  These vaccines causing so many health issues and it's fact.  Main street media of course will not say a word because they are in cahoots with big pharma.  It's all about population control."657,"I do not agree with mandatory vaccinations at all. We are a free country, not a communist one. Everyone should be able to make their own decisions about their own health. Not everyone can take some of the vaccines, and many times the vaccines don't even work, or have serious long-term effects."660,"When it comes to abortion, nobody knows exactly when an embryo can be considered a human life. For that reason, it is better to err on the side of caution. People have different definitions of life, but for me, I believe that a beating heart and a functioning brain is a good start. However, some people are not opposed to abortion up until the moment of birth. At that point, shortly before birth, it is most definitely a human life. Abortion in the late-term, while the child can survive outside of the womb, is the same thing as killing a child after it is born.

When abortion occurs, the child (or fetus) is torn apart limb by limb and removed. It is at a time when it's been proven that the fetus is able to feel pain. The process must be excruciating. After the abortion, the doctors reassemble the different limbs to make sure they have all been accounted for. It sounds a lot like ripping apart a human being.

If a child is not wanted, it can be given up for adoption. I've read reports that there are 10 potential parents trying to adopt for every abortion. The aborted child has a chance to live a good life if they are adopted, they don't have that choice if they are aborted.

People argue for abortion rights claiming it is the right of the mother to do what she wants with her own body. But abortion is not just her body, it's also the right of the body of the fetus. If the mother were so concerned about doing what she wanted with her own body, she could have chosen not to get pregnant. Just because a woman gets pregnant shouldn't be a right to end a life."661,"I think that affirmative action is overtly saying to black communities, ""We don't think you are good enough, smart enough or qualified enough on your own""  I think that there are many great candidates from every ethnicity and race, but affirmative action takes away jobs from well qualified people at times and gives them to lesser suited people based on race alone or having to fill aquota."663,"With Affirmative action, I am against it. While I understand that schools and companies may use this method, it doesn't seem fair. When it comes to hiring people or accepting people into a school, it is unfair to use certain things to measure them outside of what they are there to do. Like accepting people into a school should only be about their test scores and nothing else. Just like hiring for a job should be about who can do the best job for this companies. While affirmative action may help some people, it will harm others. Sadly in this world, there are no even playing grounds when it comes to this. Some people work harder and get certain things and there are others who work hard and don't get things. It is an unjust practice but affirmative action is just as unjust."666,"I am in favor of making all abortions illegal.  I think that life begins at conception and as a mother of four I realize what a gift it is to be pregnant.  I think that no one should be able to kill another life even if that life is very small and new, it does not make it less worthy.  I also know of many women who have regretted deeply getting an abortion and if it is illegal, women can not make a big mistake like they did.  I think that there are many wonderful pregnancy crisis centers and there is plenty of help out there, women just have to seek it out.  Abortion is never the answer.  If a women truly does not want their child, it is more morally acceptable to adopt the baby to someone else."667,"I hold that abortion should always be illegal because it is a black and white issue on all fronts.  There can be no gray area in killing an innocent baby before it is given a chance to breathe.  There are gray areas in Murder or Killing a Human, such as War or Capital Punishment, but these are not innocent acts.  I am all for Pro-Choice - I say give the baby a choice whether it wants to live or not.  The mother is allowed to spread her legs, get pregnant, and then just kill off her mistake without even informing the father!  This is ludicrous and is somehow promoted as shameless and moral in our corrupt society.  Without even bringing God into the equation, a 5 year old child knows right and wrong and knows it is wrong to kill an unborn child.  My autistic son knows this and he doesn't read the bible, go to church, or even pray!"676,"I think that standardized testing should be removed from schools and entrance exams. The days of relevance have passed us and we judge students on a whole different dimension now. The questions on those tests are out dated and hold less meaning to current students. Students have less need for this type testing and more need of inclusion into colleges without the extra hassle. I feel this way because I see my nephew going through school and learning completely different types of things like math, I cannot understand what he has been taught. When I took the SAT, it meant something about my comprehension of the information, now it is not so relevant to students as it was years ago."677,"I do not believe in defunding the police, crime will go up without police , people will know which cities have less police and go there . I've seen it happen before. My neighborhood is full of police and it's safe and less crime . I appreciate the men in blue."685,"I am for abortion and the right to choose.  Though I am morally against it, I believe that the right to choose should be given to the mother AND father."690,I slightly oppose legalizing abortion because I am a Christian and I believe that it is murder to kill an unborn baby in the womb. With that being said it is still a very complicated issue for me. I think God put humans on this earth to multiply and to create other humans and when a woman gets pregnant it is her duty to carry the pregnancy to full term and to have the baby. If people are not willing to do this they should not have sex and they should also plan very carefully who they have sex with to make sure the child will grow up in a nurturing environment. I am aware that there are complications in the pregnancy that make it to where either the woman or the child will live and it will either be one or the other so I feel that if an abortion needed to be performed in a life or death situation or if the baby was going to be born with a debilitating condition then I would support this. Also if a woman is the victim of rape or incest she should have the right to choose to get an abortion but this should be extremely limited. Overall I believe 95% of the time the baby should be carried to full term. I believe the Bible is the word of God and there are specific verses in the Bible about God breathing life into us when we are in our mother’s womb which I would interpret to mean we have life and a soul at that point. That is just what I believe.695,"Abortion is murder, nothing more.  No person has a right to take another person's life, except in defense of their life or others.  Killing a baby doesn't allow that soul to live and experience this world.  Neither the mother nor the father creates life.  Only God creates life, and only God has the right to decide how or when a life should be taken.  God has full dominion over every living thing, because he created it.  God gave us dominion over animals, and we have the right to take an animal's life, but never a person's life because that it not within our dominion.  If a doctor takes a life, as in the case of abortion, that doctor is guilty of murder, period.  The mother is guilty of murder as well.  God's punishment for murder is death.  Both should have a trial, with two witnesses (including evidence), and they should then be taken out of the courtroom and executed publically in the town square.  They cannot have salvation --in the flesh--, and must be returned to God, so they can face the soul whose body they murdered and ask for their forgiveness as well.  Then there would be no need for abortion laws, and these things would cease to happen among us.  The Law is already written."699,"Illicit drugs should never become legal under any circumstances.  If you allow small amounts of any drug to be a misdemeanor or legal, you will need large amounts of drugs to supply the users with the drugs they need.  The drug business is a cash business, where there is a lot of cash there will be a lot of guns to protect the cash and drugs.  There will  be a large amount of competition for territory.  All of this will add up to theft, crime, homelessness, and murder.  If you arrest the dealers and suppliers then you will leave helpless addicts with no where to go.  Just ask Oregon in a few years."712,"I do not believe that drugs should be legalized. This is rediculous and should not even be considered. I have had drug addiction in my family and I know the consequences. This will only increase the number of people in jails and prisons as the addicts do terrible things when on drugs. I believe that the drug companies are pushing this so that they can get richer at the expense of the citizens of this country. If they are legalized, to begin with, they will be extremely high and therefore cause more addicts to do criminal acts to acquire the drugs."713,"I think defunding the police is a pretty silly idea. If you cut the size of the police force you wont maintain a civilized society. The are where the police are defunded will become uncivilized and affluent people will move away, creating a hood like neighborhood like the inner cities of most large cities. It is so sill, that I just don't understand it. I think these people have no brains t think things out logically.  Somewhat criminally inclined people want to create an unlivable society where they are free to do whatever the want to whomever they want, whenever they want with no consequences to themselves for their actions."714,Abortion should be legal for all woman. They should be in control of their own bodies.715,"I believe the police should not be defunded because there could be major ramifications for doing so. If police are defunded there is a potential for chaos in society. If there are less police willing to work or get fired because they got defunded, criminals would commit more crimes. People would be scared to leave their homes because there are less police to protect them. There would be less resources allocated for police to respond to low level crimes or altercations. People would also be less inclined to follow traffic laws due to potentially not enough police to enforce traffic laws. Thus, it would be detrimental to society to defund the police."721,We definitely need to fund the police more. Crime is out of control especially in large cities and it is creeping into smaller areas. Stop treating criminals as victims and lock them up for longer. No cash bail so they don't get out the next hour after arrest.726,"Defunding police departments would put everyone at risk, especially those unable or unwilling to protect themselves. Human nature and history tell us that thieves and those who would seek to control others and take what they have are inescapable where people gather together. Without a police force, those who have worked for what they have and care for their families would be at never-ending risk of theft and harm and the need to protect themselves, their property and their homes would seem like a full-time job with no holds barred on doing what was necessary to do so. Violence from criminals would be routine, with law-abiding citizens resorting to the same in order to defend themselves. Those concerned with gun violence now would be in for a shock at the occurrences of it without a police presence. It doesn't take must common sense to know it's a monumentally bad idea."734,I believe there is no reason for defunding the police. I feel if the funding were raised we could train police better and bring crime rate down. i can't understand why refunding the only organization in the country meant to protect the citizens would be a good thing.736,"I hate/strongly disapprove of abortions because of multiple reasons. Firsty, it kills innocent life which had no choice in being made. Secondly, it promotes inappropriate behaviors. Thirdly, God disapproves so I do because I know its wrong."738,Defunding the police will reduce the number of cops enforcing the law.  This will result in skyrocketing crime across the board.  It also will unnecessarily demoralize cops.740,I don't believe affirmative action is constitutionally legal. We should hire based on skills and qualifications not based on the color or lack there of of a persons skin. I believe a person wants to be hired and needed because their hard work has paid off not because they were pigeon holes into a position that someone else was more qualified for because of a mandate742,Americans want less crime and less profit for inner-city drug dealers and an end to the criminal activities associated with the illegal drug trade. Legalizing the sale of drugs to adults is proposed as the most effective solution to the drug problem.Legalizing drugs would: free vast sums of money for prevention and treatment of drug abuse and for reducing its root causes; reduce the occurrence of AIDS and other diseases transmitted by drug abusers; lessen the risk of drug overdose or poisoning; and allow for better prenatal care for pregnant women with drug743,My position on defunding the police is that they should never be defunded. They have jobs and we need them.  They are here to protect us and to keep everything civil and to help us abide by the laws. Without them there would be trouble.755,Defund police - I think we need police to control society and protect normal citizens766,"I believe that abortion should remain a legal option for all women. Women should have the right to choose if she wants to keep a baby or not. There should be time limits, but the option should be available. Some times pregnancies occur in unplanned situations and it should be up to the individual to decide what to do."769,"I work for a law enforcement agency and do not understand how anyone could want to defund police. LEOs keep society orderly where everyone has a chance at safety. Victims have a defender and often a hero when licensed peace officer steps in. People have forgotten that what cops/police are: they are PEACE officers. They restore the peace. Everyone deserves the right to pursue happiness and when you are in fear of mobs destroying your home or business or even your life, society suffers. I understand some portions of society are over represented in our jails and that is a problem that must be address but less officers doesn’t mean less crime. It just means criminals will get away with it."774,"My position on the use of 'Illicit Drugs' is that it should be absolutely prohibited by the government due to its numerous negative impacts it has on the general society.Illicit drugs are mostly ban in many countries of the world because of the immoral and social effects it has on its citizen such as high crime rate,increase number in gun violence and mental health issues.So this is the more reason why use of illicit drugs should not be toyed with in order to have a sane society."782,"Defending Police will result in the rise of private and corporate police doing the job of the real police, creating a secondary prison system. Unregulated funded by different interest groups. Giving security people the power to arrest. This would make it n safe for the be public. It was would no longer be about the rule of law. It would be more about a bounty for the person interest of any organization.  A person quitting their job could get them arrested for access to confidential knowledge is one we example. Who decides the crime or punishment. Defending the police would decrease freedom not increase it."785,"I think women should have the right to get a abortion as long as it is early on and the reason i feel this way is because soo women are not ready. They may have just had a one night stand, they may no be finacial or emotioal ready. I feel like women are going to be carring the baby around for 9 months and it can be a beautful thing. However no one should be forced against their will to  do something they do not won't to do. Sometimes i feel like this is y bad things happen to babies or small children is because the women felt forced and sometimes they don't have the love the should. If a women wants to have a baby a put it up for adoption that is should be her choice as well. Yes  everone should use conterception if they do not want a baby, but sometimes conterception breaks and it is a accident. Sometime women get raped and that should be a free pass to get a abortion even if it is illegal."787,"I strongly oppose affirmative action because it creates an unfair advantage.  I have anecdotal, first hand experience with affirmative action and it's not good.  Hiring on the basis of race and not upon merit is a dangerous proposition."790,"Defunding the police has already been proven to not work. At the height of all the talk of defunding the police,  a couple of cities tried it,  and the crime rates increased significantly in those cities. It's a foolish notion to think defunding the police will decrease problems that you have with individuals that decided not to do their duty as officers."791,Abortion should not be legal with a few exceptions. Those being rape and other is mother's healthy is in danger. I am a Christian and see abortion as murder. Innocent babies are killed. We need to educate women about birth control or abstinence.  The babies could be put up for adoption and go to loving homes instead of being murdered.792,I think defunding the police is a bad idea because it will allow for less protection and more crime.796,I can understand why people would want to defund the police but that would be punishing the many for a few bad cops. They just need to be trained longer and more properly I believe instead of being defunded. We need police to keep order and peace in most cases.3,"I strongly support abortion as a basic human right. Giving birth is not without risks, both physical and psychological. There are long-term consequences to carrying a baby to term and giving birth. No one should be forced to give birth, because that potential life is not automatically of greater value than the woman who becomes pregnant. When fetal cells cannot sustain life outside of the womb, I see no harm in removing them."7,I believe Affirmative Action is wrong and should be removed all together.  It provides an unfair academic setting by allowing those that are defined as 'minorities' access based on their skin color and not their academic success.  More people of color are given more chances at things based on their skin color than those who have worked hard to create an opportunity for themselves.  Affirmative Action is not fair and is biased towards Caucasian men and women.10,"i think that standardized testing should be removed. it puts an unnecessarily high amount of pressure on kids, and forces them to compare one another to each other. standardized tests are simply not an efficient way to measure intelligence (especially considering they're timer). children are not numbers; their strengths cannot be reduced to such. i got what i would call a low score on my SAT and yet i graduated valedictorian and have been consistently on the dean's list. not to mention, people can guess on standardized tests. they're just not a good way to measure the success of somebody. you cannot rely on a three-hour exam to know the brain of an individual."12,"Legalizing drugs. 

I don't think that legalization of drugs is a good thing. There are too many people that die from drugs. Too many people want to numb their feelings and don't want to deal with everyday problems"14,Abortion should be legal because it is apart of women’s rights to have access to healthcare. It takes two people to make a baby and a woman should have the right to choose if she wants to carry a baby or not because it is her body. Society views women as a means to an end to keep producing babies instead of human beings.22,"I choose abortion, because it is a very personal to me. Uterus havers should have a right to their bodies and what happens to them."23,I think drugs should be legal but treated like alcohol. I think we spend too much money in this fight. I also think drugs like psychedelics could really benefit a certain population.25,I believe some drugs should be legalized. There are too many people in jail due to drug related charges that should not be there.30,"I believe abortion should be illegal, other than during a medical emergency. There is free access to all types of birth control and if people choose to not use them, why should they get to end a life because of it? The life of a child is just as important as the life of the mother. Mothers also need access to resources that will help them keep and raise the child."39,I don't think police should be defunded. This will result in more crime and lawlessness. It is common sense.42,"I am against mandatory vaccines because I think everyone should have body autonomy.  Although vaccines can help many, they can also be rushed and companies are not held responsible for side effects.  Also many say you can just get a medical exemption if needed (which those with complex medical conditions may need) but any medical doctor who is found to be issuing these are investigated and quickly labeled a quack. The trust the science crowd while having best intentions fails to realize that science is more fluid then fixed and people should have the right to make decisions that could effect their body for a lifetime."45,"i believe abortion should be legal, as i feel there are already so many unwanted children in foster care systems waiting to be adopted. so if abortion becames illegal, i feel that number would increase, which could also affect the crime rates globally. not everyone is ready to have a child, and in some cases, women have been raped, or had a failed contraceptive measure fail. every women deserves the right in the say with their body. if abortions become illegal, i feel vasectamies should become more mandated."50,"Vaccine mandates should be implemented. They should be implemented because there are a lot of diseases and illnesses that can be prevented by being vaccinated. Not only that, but if enough people are vaccinated some diseases can be completely eradicated. If everyone isn't vaccinated than the vaccines protective effects are less valuable and diseases can flourish. It's important that everyone is vaccinated."53,Standardized tests should not be removed from academic institutions. Standardized tests serve as a benchmark for students. Standardized tests also give institutions insight on students' academic ability.57,"I am 100000000% pro choice because first and for most, it’s NOT my body so it isn’t my place to say what someone does with theirs! The world is already too overpopulated and going down the drain, so why do we need to make it worse by adding more children. Let’s help the children that are born into terrible situations first. There are so many unfit parents who will now be forced to carry a child to term. That will set up the child for a life of potentially poverty and abuse. I could go on for days."63,"I think illegal drugs should be legalized, with exceptions. There should be a certain amount of drugs that should be accepted. This would save space in jail for those criminals who commit even bigger crimes."72,"I believe the police should be defunded due to the systemic racism that is impacting not only our country, but the people that are supposed to be keeping communities safe. I think this was highlighted during the George Floyd protest. The police have gotten away with Situations like that, but this instance was finally filmed and brought public. I believe there are many other resources that could be more beneficial than the police."73,"I think abortion shouldn't be illegal because it makes it more difficult for necessary abortions to happen as quickly as they need to be. Doctors can also manipulate the situation and refuse a medically necessary abortion. Abortion should only be used as a medical procedure when the mothers life is in danger or the child isnt developing correctly. It shouldnt be so widely accessible. It should be accessible as easily as possible when it's medically necessary though, and making it illegal will muddy the waters."77,I think abortion should be legal.  I feel that a woman's body is their own and that a human should make their own choices regarding whether or not to give birth.  I think that a lot of issues in society are caused by people who were had by parents who were not prepared.80,I pick the issue about abortion because it applies to me as a woman. I feel like it should be up to each woman to choose what decisions she makes with her body. If someone doesn't want an abortion then they can choose not to get one instead of forcing their religious views on others.82,I believe the police should be defunded because the police don’t actually help the general population at all and only serve as a standing army to intimidate the people. I believe we should invest in stopping crime systemically and stopping it before it starts since the police don’t do that.86,"I believe that everyone should get vaccinated. Not everyone is able to get vaccines due to health issues so this keeps them the most safe. If the majority of people are vaccinated this also creates herd immunity and certain diseases will become more easily eradicated. Some people do not want to get vaccinated due to religious or personal beliefs. As shown recently, those actions are what drags on things like COVID."89,"Abortions shouldn't be illegal, all that does it create dangerous ways for women to still get abortions. Men who biologically cannot carry a baby shouldn't determine whether women should be forced to have them or not. There are many reasons to terminate a pregnancy besides life threatening ones and that's okay. There should still be ability to choose. Men can get multiple women pregnant at once yet one a women is pregnant she is out of commission (for a lack of better words) for almost a year, yet we are the ones being controlled. People claim they're pro life but they don't care about the life already here, those in foster care go through hell but they don't care about that, put the baby up for adoption as if it's that easy to even adopt a baby. People have to jump through hoops to prove they can be good parents just to adopt one child so many people don't pass the assessment nor have the patience fr it but you want all these women to have babies they don't want and just shove them in the foster care system. If abortions become illegal then the man that helped make said baby should be forced to take care of the mother & the baby since the women is being forced to have it."93,"I choose abortion. I feel like the government has well overstepped their boundaries overturning this law. The men that made this decision are disgusting. If it was one of their daughters, sisters or wives who were ever raped, sick or in a predicament where they would need to have an abortion, they would be sick with themselves., These services are something that needs to be available everywhere for women all over the USA."96,"I believe that drugs should be legalized. The reason I believe this is because people are going to do drugs whether they are illegal or not. So if they are going to do drugs, then you might as well make sure that the  drugs they are taking are tested and regulated. The more regulated they are the less violence surrounding drug trafficking as well. Legalizing drugs would also create a lot more job opportunities, improving the economy. It would also help with the stigma surrounding drugs and I feel that people would be more likely to ask for help if they are suffering from addiction, as well as have more support and understanding from other people."100,"I think specific drugs should be legalized. For example, cannabis should be federally legal across the board. More states are recreationally and medically legalizing it. There is science behind how it can help medicinally such as cancer patients and for pain management. And it is better than prescription pain killers that contributes to the opioid crisis. Shrooms and psychedelics as well are becoming more popular with helping with mental health issues which is also itself become more of an issues in the past few years."107,"Making abortion illegal is one of the most abhorrent things you can do to women. Especially when we have bad social safety nets in place, restricted housing, and the highest medical bills in the world."113,"Abortion should be a legally protected right. The arguments being made about ""killing babies"" is absolutley ridicolous. If a baby is a bay at like 20 weeks and not collection of cells, then take it out of the mother..... Yeah, its not a baby. To force a person into delivering a human into this world is not only medically dangerous but mentally devastating. The united nations labels forced birth a s a war crime. Quite frankly, I agree. Taking away abortion is a slippery slope to taking away more and more rights from women. This ""debate"" is only a debate because of evangelacist christians who believe in every baby being born.... until that baby is born and forget about them. I can event describe how scared I am for the future oif this country."115,I think vaccines should be mandated to help stop the spread of diseases.118,"I believe abortion should be legal. In certain cases, it is what's best for the physical and/or mental health of the person getting. it is also simply the person's right and choice what happens to their body and not anyone else's. Having a child is a world-altering event and should not be a choice to be ripped away."121,"Standardized tests should not exist anymore. I firmly believe that it is unreasonable to use a score from a single exam to determine eligibility to enter a school. For example, what if someone has good grades but they do very poorly on the standardized exam? They don’t get to go to a good school because of a test? I also believe that grades shouldn’t be a determining factor for intelligence because numbers do not define people."124,"I feel like abortion should be legal because it's a woman's choice whether she wants to go through the complications of childbirth and the struggles of raising a child because 7/10 the if the parents are split, the child goes with the mother."129,I feel that mandating vaccines is a breach of our personal choices we should be allowed to make.130,Drugs I’m pro it because if you listen to a lot of research microdosing has really saved a lot of peoples lives and make positive changes to your daily life.134,"I believe the abortion should be legal because not only does outlawing it go against the constitution, it also results in the deaths of countless women. In the constitution they say that church and state are to be seperate. Fetuses are only considered people under modern Christianity, and thus this violates that construct. Beyond that, many women die during childbirth, and know they will in advance."135,"I believe America should defund the police. There are so many injustices taken place where people of color are being attacked due to oppression as demonstrated by police. Evidence proves giving more money to the police, worsens the situation for people of color and perpetuates racism. This situation has affected me at a personal level where cops are incredibly oppressive for very minor offenses. Ordinary people should not have to lose their lives over cops that take no accountability for their actions."137,"Defund the police. They don’t need so much money, when other areas like education are so low on cash. Them having all of this money also is what makes them so powerful, which can lead to racist actions being swept under the rug"141,I believe abortion should be legal for a plethora of reasons. Not everyone should be forced to be a parent if they dont want to be and women who have been sexually assaulted should not feel the pressure of having to carry through a pregnancy they dont want. I would prefer children be born into situations where they are loved and welcome and if that means a clump of cells in a small sac have to be destroyed then so be it.142,"Defunding the police. I do not believe that we should defund the police because it does not seem to target the source of frustration for many people. I believe that greater training, more effective background checks, and greater resources would likely result in police forces that are more prepared to engage with the public and deescalate tense situations without the use of lethal force. These improvements require greater funding, not less."146,"I support a vaccine mandate while allowing for minimal exceptions based upon medical criteria. No religious exemptions. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing and additional, more contagious variants keep appearing because so many people have not received even one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. It is a public health crisis that affects our most weak and vulnerable, elderly and low income. How we treat the most vulnerable members of our society says a lot about our society."148,"I think that all drug use should be legalized, but selling hard drugs should remain illegal. I believe resources are better spent trying to help addicts rather than put them in jail. I think that some drugs are arbitrarily banned when the effects of alcohol are so much worse."150,"I fully support legalizing abortion again. I think that the government should not be able to control and regulate the ability for women to do things to their own body. Pregnancy is dangerous in some situations, and can affect women physically and mentally, taking a huge toll on their body. Forcing women to give birth can injure and sometimes kill them. You should never regulate something like that"153,"Legalizing abortions : against 
As a women that does not want a baby, if I accidentally get pregnant I works like to have an abortion. If something goes wrong in my pregnancy I would like to have an abortion. I think women should be able to have the option to have one if needed."160,"The topic I choose is defunding the police. I think defunding the police will reduce them just accepting anybody as a cop and will make sure they take people who are dedicated and have the passion for the job and protecting the lives of the citizens also, if they get defunded then it means many people will lose their jobs and the streets won't be safe anymore. There will be increase in crimes and loss of lives so to me I think they shouldn't be defunded but instead, there should be good training and management to bring out the best in them."165,"Abortions should be legal for everyone. When safe abortions are available you don't have to get one if you don't want to or don't agree with it. Removing access to abortions all together is harmful to anyone who may want one someday. There are countries where abortions are illegal and you can check their statistics, they still try to have abortions and many times the pregnant person is harmed or even killed. If abortions are made illegal then financial support must be provided to the person giving birth and/or orphanages and foster homes."166,I think drug use should be legalized with controls. Much like Amsterdam drugs are available to adults. There will be a drop in drug related crimes. It is up to the adult to use and a real abuser cannot be stopped with penalties. We need to trust society to police themselves. Alcohol is legal and the vast majority of people don't drink themselves to death.167,"Defunding the police. While I get the reason some people have. Mainly  to give less power to the polic, I think that is a horrible idea. The police are what protects us the people and upholds the law. It make little sense to take away funding that they may need to protect human life."171,"I am writing about making illicit drugs legal. I do not agree with legalizing illicit drugs. Right now, as it is, people are abusing drugs and dying from overdosing. They do not need for illicit drugs to be legalized just so they can abuse them and go too far with them. Some people don't know when to quit/when to say ""enough is enough"" (some people do). Since not everyone knows when ""enough is enough,"" illicit drugs should not be legalized since they can be abused."173,My position in standardized testing is that I think they should have tests for students to allow them to see if they are ready for college and allows them to see where they stand with verbal and math.178,"This War on Drugs will never end unless we decide to make drugs legal. Let the government get the tax money from all the drugs that are bought. I've been successful with alcohol, with marijuana. Is the time to just legalize all of the drugs so we won't have as much crime. There will be more tax money to use for the homeless battered women missing people"180,"In regards to vaccine mandates, I hold the view of opposition. The main reason I hold this view is because people should ultimately have the freedom to decide what goes into their body. Also, there could be moral and religious conflicts depending on the vaccine type as well as long-term side effects that weren't properly accounted for during the development and testing process, although typically low-risk. However, I am not opposed to certain places requiring vaccines to be on premise and around vulnerable people, such as hospitals or nursing homes."181,Vaccines should be mandated to protect the public and create herd immunity.185,"As a black man, I firmly believe that affirmative action should be abolished. I think it makes people think they can get somewhere just because of the color of their skin. Whoever is more qualified and suited for the job should always get it."186,I believe that abortion should be Legal. I dont believe that anyone should have legal authority over anyones body but the women involved with the abortion. I believe that women should be allowed the ability and anononimity187,One of the issues were about abortion being illegal. My position is that it should be legal because it is a woman's choice to go through that process since it is her body. I do think there should be a certain term that is considered to far in to follow through the process.190,I do not think vaccinations should be forced upon us. I think I should be able to decide what goes into my own body. We have no idea what are actually in these vaccines and what harm they may do to us in the future. That should be MY decision.191,"Vaccinations are important for the overall health of society. I understand parents that refuse, because I also have a kid that has adverse reactions, EVERY TIME, and has even ended up in the ER multiple times after a vaccination. However, he lives. And he helps his community by being immunized against the things can can threaten it, and the lives of his friends and himself. we sometimes delay a vaccination, and as an honesty-check, he still can't get his Meningococcal B vax because it shuts his system down for some reason and we end up having to have him admitted, but he gets every vaccine he can. his brothers will not be at risk because we all stay vaxxed in this house. When pandemics happen, or epidemics, or flu season, we all minimize contact and get what we can for shots that are recommended, because it's not about just us. If it was, I would never put my son through the stuff that makes him so sick and scared sometimes after a shot. but it just isn't all about him, or me, or our comfort. It is about all of us."193,"I strongly support a mandatory vaccine mandate because when infectious diseases become a public threat, the vaccine is the only way the public can recover and go back to normal fast. If everyone in this country is vaccinated, they will be less likely to catch and spread the virus to other people. And vulnerable people who catch the virus will be less likely to be gravely ill and spread it to other people. We've seen vaccines work before with Polio and they are safe. However, when only a bit more than half of the population of a country is vaccinated, those who are unvaccinated will keep on catching the virus and spreading it around, potentially spreading it to vulnerable people who even after getting vaccines still have a low immune system, such as people with transplants, cancer, etc."195,I support mandated vaccines because I believe it would help to prevent future pandemics. And also for public safety.197,"I think the majority of drugs should be legal. The government does not get to take away freedoms of someone to their individual body regardless of societal consequences. The idea that by putting away drug users (non violent, or violent) we are significant increasing safety with society is propaganda to silence those who are screwed by the system. So their credibility and power is taken away. Drugs do not have as big of a negative impact as society and the government makes us what to think. The real causative negative impact on our society comes from big corporations and WASPs."200,"I am for defunding the police IF that means money is directed to programs and people called in place of the police for calls that deal with mental health issues or other de-escalatory type situations. I do not believe Police should not be eliminated entirely as power vacuums only encourage more violence. Police officers should be trained like nurses, doctors, and other professions, out of their own individual pockets so that when they are on the job they have thoughtfully prepared and lead with measures to deescalate incidents and use force only when necessary. I believe this because I have two family members that are LEOs and I have heard a lot about the culture fostered in police forces. They are militarized and have an Us VS. Them mentality that leads to violence over de-escalation and is born from lack of deep training and police culture."202,"Abortion is a complicated topic, but it is unethical to not give a mother options in the cases of rape, incest, young age, divorce, poverty, health risks, etc."206,"Abortion should be legal.  Noone should be told what to do with their body.  If someone was raped, underage and unprepared, on drugs.  There are so many reasons people may want an abortion and we should respect these decisions."210,"I can't understand a world in which drugs could be legal, though it depends on the drug. Something dangerous like meth should never be legalized. It sets a horrible precedent that we can't control a problem and so we just legalize it. Drugs are dangerous for the users and for the people having to interact with the drug users. Making it legal will expand access and make the problem greater. There is no societal ""good"" to most illegal drugs. This isn't something like alcohol, that can be used in moderation and safely. Most illegal drugs are ALWAYS a danger to the user and the public."213,"I strongly oppose the removal of standardized tests. As someone who had to take several of these tests when I was a student, I find these tests redundant, and have no meaning in my future. I took these tests just to get into a college and study a profession that has nothing to do with anything that was on those tests. Since some universities only accept you if you have a certain score on these tests, stress tends to build up on students wanting to get a good score."216,"I think drugs should be legalized because it would to people commit less drug related crimes. Additionally, some famous people face almost no repercussions when it comes to drug related crimes, so why are less fortunate people punished so heavily?"219,"I believe abortion should be legal because no one has a right to tell a women what to do with her body plain and simple. That person will just have to deal with any mental consequences that may arise but it’s better than making a women have a baby she doesn’t want. And what if a medical emergency deems it medically necessary , lost of one or even two lives could have been prevented. So it all boils down to womens choice!"225,"I am pro affirmative action because people of color historically are disadvantaged in society and in education. Therefore, they do not get the same opportunities as caucasian people to have access to good education, tutors, safe schooling ,etc."228,I think vaccines should be mandatory since it'll help decrease and elimnate the spread of diseases. An example of this is Smallpox. It was very common for people to have until most people became vaccinated which almost elimnated it for future generations to the point where we don't need to take  a vaccine for it. There's other examples with different diseases like polio or syphilis.229,"You have to get vaccinated.  It's a moral imperative.  There is no science against it, only weaponized propaganda.  Folks not vaccinating and not socially distancing is why the pandemic exploded the way it did.  It is selfish to worry more about your freedom NOT to get vaccinated when that course of action contributes to the death and suffering that has changed all of our lives so very drastically."230,"On the topic of defunding the police, I believe it would be a horrible idea. The main reason is crime would run rampant. I understand the position that people want to defund them because of brutality, but you can not have a society has no order. Possibly better training and making officers lose their jobs, and pay restitution, when they abuse power would be a better solution"233,"I have no problem with weed being legalized. I have many friends who smoke weed and they never get violent or agresive. 
It would also benifit the community."236,"With standardized tests, my position is that there should be an alternative if the student is not proficient in testing. Just because the student didn’t get the right answer on the test does not mean that through different testing metrics that the kid didn’t know the answer. I hold this opinion because for my ACT score I received the same score three different times. I am not great at tests but I am not terrible but if there was some other way to test knowledge then I may have gotten more scholarship funds for school."238,"Abortion should always be legal. It is an individual choice that should be able to be made by each woman in their individual situation. While extreme cases, such as rape and possible life-threatening consequences for the mother, exist, there are day-to-day decisions that should remain only for the individual affected to make. Women who cannot afford to travel to relieve medical procedures are unfairly forced to remain pregnant and birth children they may not want to have. In my opinion all decisions regarding a person's body should be hers alone to make."239,"I am against vaccine mandates, because members of my family have had heart complications due to the covid vaccine. I am not against the vaccine in general though. I believe it helps society as a whole"240,I support defunding the police because they have proven time and time again that they really do not put that money to good use. The money the police waste could go into other neglected parts of our communities. Mental health and schools would be better things to support. Police don't need money for fancy cars and weaponry when they just use them for wrong purposes.241,abortion. defund police vaccine mandate chose for self consider safety244,"I think that vaccines should be mandatory for all those who can safely take them, in order to protect children and those with compromised immune systems"249,I don't think standardized tests should be taken away - I think we can solve the issue by providing funding to low income students who wish to apply to college but may not be able to afford the test.250,Drug kegalization253,"I think getting the vaccine shot is the most important one, and because who did not get the shot made Covid here to stay same people who did not want to stay home in lock down around 2020"259,"Defunding the police
I am against this. We need more training and resources for police officers. They are protecting the public from criminals and help communities in many other ways. People who want to defund are not protecting these officers who risk their lives for us each day. If we have less or no police presence crime will be out of control more than it is and people will behave like the wild west."271,I'm slightly oppose about defunding police because that decision will affect many police officers that are innocent and really want to make justice in the right way.275,I feel like most drugs should be federally legalized or at least decriminalized. I don't want the government telling people what they can and cannot put in their bodies. Also I feel like we need to increase federal revenue and this is a great way to do it.280,"I think abortion should be legal because it's a medical procedure that doctors (who have years of experience and are under constant license review) would know how to handle for each individual best, not law makers."281,"Abortion should be legal because that is a woman's choice. A woman should have control over her body. If abortion is made illegal, it carries the risk of more abandoned children, more kids in foster care, more ways to have illegal abortions, more deaths of mother and child, and more rapes."282,I support the decision to legalize any drugs for personal use for the simple fact the stigma behinds these drugs do more harms than helps people since they have to hide usage.289,"I think abortion should be legal. There are many reasons why women get abortions, and frankly, I think the health and safety of the women already present on this earth are far more important than that of an undeveloped fetus. One reason why someone might get an abortion is that they have health issues that prevent them from having a safe pregnancy. Having a child could put their life at risk. If I was given that decision, I would choose my own life, no question. Another reason why someone might need an abortion is that they were raped. I believe that having to carry a child to term that was the product of something so traumatic could be deeply damaging to the mental health of the person carrying it. Abortion should be legal to ensure the health and safety of anyone with a uterus."290,I think that the police should not be defunded. Defunding and taking money away from them would only lead to worse problems than what we currently deal with now.291,"I guess with vaccine mandates and forcing people to get the vaccine, I think that the idea in theory is a strong one but that like everything, people take it too far. You should not be treated like a secondary citizen for not wanting to become vaccinated and there shouldn't be anything that forces any person to do something that they do not want to do. This is why I believe that I would oppose any sort of mandate that makes it harder for the average person to live their lives."294,I think all drugs should be legal. I think by making them illegal you just add to the mystery and make people want to try them. trying a drug one time bc you are curious could be your last bc so much is cut with fent these days. It is now safer to have fda approved forms of all drugs and have safe using sights to reduce deaths and harm295,"I think drugs should be legalized, to cut down on people in prison for nonviolent offenders, the user can have access to clean drugs and clean needles, it's safer, and if someone overdoses and dies it's Darwinism in action."297,"I think abortion should be legal. I don't see a logical reason that it shouldn't be. Religion doesn't belong in our laws. Women should have the right to choose. In instances of rape, incest, and overall health and life of the mother I don't understand how a doctor could deny a woman an abortion. It shouldn't even be a discussion."300,"Legalizing drugs could help reduce deaths. There would be less laced drugs, less violence in dealing situations, less people sent to jail for using and therefore less jail deaths, etc. Supplying drug users with a place to consume socially and responsibly could create more jobs also, similar to bars. If someone is obviously having too much, they are cut off, similar to drinking at bars."303,"I believe abortion should be legal for many reasons.  Most paramount would be the health of the mother and her right to choice.  Sometimes there are terrible things that happen ( rape or disease), which would cause the mother to either not want to or not be able to carry a baby to term.  There is no reason that she should have to drive hours out of state to try to make her choice in a state where it is allowed."306,The issue I choose is the legalization of drugs. My position is pro legalization. The War on Drugs has been a castastrophe and has not achieved the outcomes it was designed for. We need to take a different approach to drug addiction and fight it at its source. Drugs being illegal has not reduced the number of people addicted to substances. It has also been a disaster when it comes to incarcerating non violent offenders who need help not punishment.307,"Vaccine mandates.
I'm very against vaccine mandates. Covid vaccine hurt several people I know and they will never be the same because of it."310,Vaccine mandates go against the foundation on which this country was built. It’s anti-American.321,"I think police should be defunded because it doesn't mean completely taking away their funding, but better allocating it after analyzing what the people's taxes are actually spent on. There are many poorly trained officers that don't do any real serving of the people, as many bodycams and news reports have shown. Our prisons are overpopulated and a problem for another study- but many officers have their own personal agenda they follow rather than the actual law. If not drastically cut then resources need to be reallocated for better training and ethics."326,No position really330,I am opposed to mandatory vaccinations only because I think that everyone should be able to decide if they want to vaccinated. Even when I had COVID I did not want to get a vaccine.336,"I truly believe standardized tests should be thrown out because they truly serve no one. They do not serve the teachers because they have to waste precious time to teach for the tests instead of teaching their set curriculum and only upper class schools have separate classes for them to learn the SAT/ACT information from. The kids do not benefit because there is nothing to be learned from standardized tests and it's simply a tool to use against underprivileged children when trying to attend colleges. Lastly, even the state does not benefit because there are way more underfunded schools than funded ones so the number of college attendees will drop and badly represent these underfunded schools."337,"I don't think the police should be defunded. They aren't interested in where policy may go in the future or where it is leaning now; they are strictly there to enforce civility by enforcing the law. However, in spite of this, there are instances of police not strictly enforcing every law absolutely. When treated with respect they are often understanding and they will respect your rights regardless. Though there are cases where this is not true, these would be fringe cases that should be dealt with individually, not by defunding the police. All black market trade is only profitable due to enforcement by the law. Even if you would not turn to the police for help, who is your grandmother going to turn to for help when there is no one else?"342,"abortion should be legal. any individual should hold the power to decide and choose for their own body. 
especially when the choice could mean life or death due to health complications, or be a decision one should be able to make if a victim of sexual violence. 
additionally, contraceptives and education and knowledge on them isn't readily available for everyone and at no fault of their own/ the individual, so they should not be punished and have the choice. 
I've had two abortions myself in DV situations."350,"I oppose drugs being legalized because there are far too many consequences compared to the benefits. Although some may argue about the benefits that legalizing drugs can bring, no matter how they argue, they can't avoid the truth about the consequences. At most these people will sweep the consequences under the rug or pretend not to know in order to push the legalization for their own ulterior, greedy purposes. It's the truth, drug legalization will bring a lot of income, not only to the grey side of the world, but also the so-called 'upright' government. There are lots of interests involved for those already in power, and many of them are for this purpose. On the other hand, it's the people that will suffer. Crime rates will rise even further, the people's money would flow into the drug overlord's pockets, and the low-class people will be puppets under the control of whitewashed crime syndicates."354,"I think certain drugs like THC for example, should be legalized because both alcohol and cigarettes are legal, and both of those are far more harmful. There's no fatal overdosing on THC, unlike some other drugs, so I can understand SOME restriction. However, I don't believe marijuana, or it's THC component should be on that list."372,"I am generally pro-choice when it comes to abortion. In my eyes, abortion is a necessary medical procedure for many people who may be put in danger if the pregnancy is not aborted. We have seen recently what illegal abortions lead to. Women have faced life threatening situations because they couldn't abort the pregnancy, and some have had life changing side effects because of it. On top of that, illegal abortions do not prevent abortion, they prevent safe abortion. Women will still abort their pregnancy if they are motivated enough, and personally, I don't think a woman should be put in danger for wanting an abortion. Why is it better for a child to be born into a family that doesn't want them and potentially be neglected and abused?"374,"I believe abortion being illegal is a ridiculous notion. Women should have the option to choose if they want to abort their unborn child. This is due to a multitude of reasons as to why abortion can actually help save the life of a laboring mother who may suffer from birth complications. In addition, having an abortion for cases such as rape or because the family may not be financial up to par is something that should be available as an option."388,"I personally support the abolishment of standarized tests. I don’t think it’s fair to have a “one size fits all” exam determine educational placement. I personally did terribly on my SATs and GREs because I struggle with the standarized test system. There should be other factors that determine placement, not just an exam. These tests are also expensive - the actual exam and the study materials. Those with less money are at a disadvantage. It’s just not a fair system."391,This is work is hard. And i developd words and  ew thinking. And using some bad isusses.393,I chose affirmative action because it is still hard for many black people that are still dealing with prejudice today. It will still take a long time for it to end but we need to keep it enforced into society today397,"I choose abortion rights as one of the three issues that I was presented with. My position about abortion rights is that every woman should have the right to abort her pregnancy. I hold my opinion about abortion rights because I think it is unfair for women to not have the choice with their own bodies on whether or not they can give birth. Many people are also unfit to be parents, and it would be unfair to children to be born to people that are irresponsible."398,"I think abortion should be legal because of the fact that forcing pregnant folk to give birth can endanger both lives, lead to abandonment or abuse within the foster system, and gives the pregnant person less control over their own body and agency."401,"Abortion is a basic medical right, and the fact that the decision to make it illegal is determined by people unable to get pregnant is enough of an indication that we're doing something wrong here"402,"I think drugs should be legalized, because it would reduce the number of incarcerated people and it would make it easier to help people when they're not constantly worried about being arrested. Drugs being illegal doesn't stop people from doing them and drug addicts shouldn't be incarcerated for their addiction."406,"I understand and accept some level of vaccine mandates. Personally, I am happy to receive them since I know I am healthy enough to aid in herd immunity. My hesitation with more extreme mandates (entertainment venues, government work, etc) comes from knowing someone who has many health issues but is having a very hard time finding a physician who can explain what is wrong. Them, and people like them, should not have to sacrifice good means of living and social time because they are uncomfortable getting a vaccine they do not know will harm them or not. A lot of times, those people are living on the fringes of society, living in poverty, and/or struggling to get by, and cutting access to many such things isolates them further, despite their willingness to take other precautions. The whole point of herd immunity is to get ENOUGH people vaccinated to prevent further mutations and outbreaks, but not everyone is able to receive a medical or religious exemption, and those who toe the line are stuck suffering from excessive mandates."407,"I believe that we should make vaccines mandatory. Getting vaccinated helps prevent you and others from getting sick. It will stop the spread of certain illnesses. People who have weak immune systems due to health problems, won’t die because they won’t have to worry about something like a flu spreading."413,"Abortion should be legal. It is sometimes even medically necessary, to save the life of the mother. Regardless of if it is medically necessary or not, a woman should be allowed to choose what to do with her own body."414,I believe abortion should be legal because in our constitution everyone is given the right of their person and when laws are made to stop abortions it strips the autonomy away from the women in the country to fall in line with a patriarchal agenda. It is dangerous to make abortions illegal because women will still get them they will just be unsafe415,I support affirmative action in general because it is intended to level the playing field for disadvantaged groups. I do not know all of the types of affirmative actions so I cannot say that I would support all affirmative actions 100% . I hold the view because my mom talks a lot about minority issues and I have taken classes related to those issues.416,"i think vaccines are good, abortion should be"417,"Drugs should be decriminalized so that drug users can be treated for mental health issues instead of being imprisoned. Our current abstinence-only approach to drug use does not solve the underlying reasons why people use drugs. It also makes drug use less safe, leading to more overdoses and health consequences such as HIV and hepatitis. With a less criminal approach to drug use, people can be treated humanely and drug use might actually decrease."418,"I am strongly against the legalization of 'hard' drugs. I have this opinion because the 'hard' drugs brought up have no health benefits to anybody. Cocaine, heroin, fentanyl. None of those are going to save people, only going to make the drug business boom, which is something the government, especially, doesn't want to happen. We legalize 'hard' drugs, we are basically handing over the government to them since they will run every financial thing in America. 
I say this position in regards of only 'hard' drugs. I do believe in the legalization of marijuana since it is not only natural, but it also is beneficial to people struggling with their health. 
I do not want future generations to be full of addicts because of our decision to legalize something so unnatural and harmful to ones body."422,I strongly believe abortions should be legal. We live in a world where women are often shun down and their voice are not heard because men want to power over and control women's bodies and choices. We've worked hard and strong just for women to be able to vote. The push for abortions to be illegal needs to stop. This is not a safe world to live in and we must fix it423,I don't know.425,"Drug legalization.

Drug users are only inherently criminals due to drugs being illegal in the first place. It's not a criminal issue, but truly a medical one, in my opinion."426,"If illegal drugs were legalized, they could be more available to scientists to study and create safe versions of medications for. Also the punishments for posessing and using these drugs would be less, allowing for drug addicts to spend time recovering rather than time in jail."430,"I believe that abortion should be legal. It is a women's choice whether or not she chooses to have a child, not the government's. It's also a huge health concern to restrict access to that part of healthcare. Not everyone going for an abortion is someone who just made a mistake. Some women are raped and sexually assaulted, and some women can't afford to have a child. The empowerment a women has in making that decision is a huge thing, and the government is seriously making a mistake with the current decision to make it illegal. Better health outcomes and decisions are pertinent for women's reproductive health."431,i am strongly against affirmative action. it takes away from those who are more qualified.432,"I think abortion should be legal. There are way too many people being born for the wrong reasons, into bad homes. Abortion is also a medical right that affects the mother. No one should tell someone else what they can/cannot do with their body that has an impact on the rest of their life."434,"Power always corrupts to some degree. Weapons give power and are dangerous. Positions of authority give power and are very often morally unjust. Police spending far outweighs the 'good' that it provides. This money would be better spent on education, housing, healthcare, etc.. The argument that crimes would increase with less police spending are flawed and incorrect. Crimes are committed out of necessity or mental illness. By providing all people with the things they need by default, as well as providing real mental welfare, crimes would decrease far more than by weaponizing an untrained unsympathetic reactive force."437,I think affirmative action is important because for too long minorities have not had equal opportunity. AA would insure or at least strengthen the abilty to gain access to higher education and the upper levels of employment.438,"I’m still unsure on vaccine mandates, I feel that we should be responsible citizens and get them. But my concern is some people may have allergic reactions."446,"I believe that police departments should be defunded due to their massive budgets, the cultural attitudes that they produce and reinforce, and the continued ineffectiveness of our police forces to handle certain cases. I do not think that the police should be entirely defunded but I do think that presently they have lost a lot of their effectiveness and their trust with the public. If they wish to be operating with such inflated operating budgets then they should be more beholden to the communities that they supposedly protect. Until their are massive changes to the current structure the money would be much better spent on other areas."447,"I choose the mandated vaccines issue. I am against that because I feel as though it should be up to the individual when it comes to health choices. There are many reasons someone may not want a vaccine, whether it's religious, health, or personal beliefs. People should never be forced to take a vaccine without having any say. It severely imposes on personal freedom and that's something that no one aside from the person considering getting the vaccine should be deciding on."451,Defund the police. I'm for it. The funds that are being used to militarize out police could go to things to better help the public.456,"Standardized testing because I have a baby who will be going into the education system before too long. And it seems to not be succeeding very well a lot of states have very low education success rates.

Obviously teaching to the standardized test is not 100% effective in every situation where every state. I think other options should be explored. So that we can continue to improve the education to our children. Doing the same old same old is just not going to cut it."461,"I support abortion because I think the pros outweigh the cons. If you just make it before a certain time in the pregnacy then it should be legal. I think that because of rape victims children than got abused and pregnant shouldnt have to carry the child, simply because it's a womans right if she wants to be a mother or carry a child."463,"I think that drugs should not be legalized because they are illegal for a reason. The effects that they can have on people can be dangerous to others in society. If someone is under the influence of these drugs, they may go crazy and do things they would not do if they were not on these drugs. They may also overdose and cause harm to themselves. It can be dangerous to make these drugs legal."466,I’m choosing the legalization of drugs. I chose this one because I believe it should be legalized everywhere as it can help some people with pain469,"I believe all abortions should be legal. I hold this belief because men have full control over their bodies and women do not. We are not just incubators to produce offspring, we are people with hopes and dreams and we should be able to pursue our lives without the threat of pregnancy ruining them, without the fear of rape taking away our lives. Abortion is not a decision that any woman makes lightly, it is life altering regardless. Late term abortions are almost always due to a threat that could end the woman's life or there is a problem with the fetus that makes it ""incompatable with life"". No woman should have to live with that fetus and know it will be stillborn, she should always have the option to humanely end that pregnancy. If abortion is made illegal, it takes the rights away from half of the country and will end the lives of countless women who feel they need to seek out illegal means to end their pregnancies. Making abortion illegal does not end abortion, it simply ends safe abortion."470,"Legalizing drugs is a tough topic because I think they should be legal in the sense, you should not go to jail for it. However, I think there should be regulations because I dont want people getting addicted easier because of it being legal. Maybe having safer access to drugs so there are less overdoses ."476,"I believe that abortion should be legalized because each woman deserves the right to choose and have control over their body. Furthermore, women will have hazardous abortions at home if it is criminalized. It is healthcare that should not be denied."477,"Defunding the police is a difficult topic to argue either side. I minored in criminology and on one hand we could be using that money to support rehabilitation programs, educating youth, helping homeless, etc. Basically, we could be using the money on preventing crimes rather than punishing for crimes, especially smaller offenses.  On the other hand defunding the police stunts advances in technology like surveillance and forensic testing."483,standardized testing is out of date. The education process is different for all486,"When it comes to the issue of whether or not police should be defunded, I personally believe that the tax dollars of citizens can be more effectively used to prevent the creation of criminals, rather than simply locking them up. Crime historically stems for those who feel they need to be criminals to survive. With the money previously used to fund police stations, not to mention the tax dollar drain from high legal fees and payouts that are routinely paid by police stations due to officer misconduct, communities could instead be improved so that far less people will become criminals in the first place. I personally do not believe in abolishing all police, as there will always be crime, but the relocation of funds to preventive measures could drastically decrease the amount, to the point where few cops are even needed to manage the problem."488,"I think that standardized tests like the ACT and SAT should not be the main factor used to determine if a student should be accepted into a college or not. The tests themselves are expensive and as a single mom, I struggled to be able to pay for my daughter to take them. I also lacked the money to get her individualized tutoring for those tests which also helps increase the scores. I feel like wealth should not be needed to determine success on the test or not. 
There is also no data that suggests scoring well on those tests means you will be successful in college.  A student who scored lower on those tests can end up doing better academically than a student who did better."490,"I think standardized tests should be removed from academic admissions because at the end of the day, they don't mean anything except that you can pass or fail a test. They don't test most knowledge that is actually taught in schools, and they are phrased in a way that requires additional studying just to pass. It puts extra stress on students because they have to study to pass their classes, possibly work jobs, do homework, and then study for their standardized tests. Plus, most are costly and it is fairly difficult to get a fee waiver."497,"I believe standardized tests should be taken out of the American education system and I believe this for several reasons. One, school seems to be test-based and kids aren’t being taught for learning’s sake. Second, not everyone is a great test taker or something like a bad day or circumstances could lower someone’s score. I don’t believe a test score is all encompassing of one’s ability and knowledge on a subject"498,Legal abortion shouldn't be something controversial. It's as simple as the fact that it's up to the person to decide what they want about their body.501,I think abortion should be legal under any and all circumstances because it is a medical issue that is no one's business but the patient and their doctor.502,"I believe that the police should be defunded, or at least have a substantial decrease in funds, because they are clearly overfunded. Those funds could be reallocated to areas that are currently underfunded, such as: schools, communities, homelessness, and hospitals. I hold this opinion because I see so much chaos in my community with the homeless crisis and horrible roads, yet police are driving down the road in newer, nicer vehicles. I also feel like the police do little to contribute to bettering the conditions of my town and they should therefore lose some/most of their funding."516,I fully support legalizing weed. Psychedelics as it helps with pain and anxiety and depression521,"I support legalization of drugs. Police can focus on more high profile arrests like killers, assaults, ect. It would make people do less crime because they wouldn't have to run from the police and use violence. It would make the prisons less overcrowded and make room for more dangerous people."526,"I feel most strongly about the issue of making drugs legal. As someone who suffers from the types of mental health issues that psychedelics at least have been proven to help (PTSD for sure, but I feel like my diagnoses of MDD and GAD may also be supported), I am for legalisation. Unfortunately, not all drugs are created equal. Things like opiates don't genuinely help people. They either make you so numb to your depression you feel okay living, or they aid people in a lot of pain who are dying to die a less painful death. Neither of these are permanent solutions, though the latter is more understandable. After that, they are not a solution for temporary pain, because they are so highly addictive, and most people don't know if they are susceptible to becoming addicted... until they become addicted. Marijuana has its uses, but more often than not, it's exploited as purely a way to get high, not for any genuine pharmaceutical or actual purposes. There are tons of different cannabinoids, I believe some of these should be continued to be restricted and others legalised as they are currently. Research shows that early exposure to THC can affect Schizophrenia in young men in their late teens. THC shouldn't even be an option. I could go on a rant about lab-created drugs, but to condense this, I'm mostly against those (thinking mostly of things intended to mimic THC, which have been proven to cause psychosis in some)."533,SAT or standaried test score are hugely overvalued  by colleges. by abolishing them we can better look at the other attribuites of a admission to the college and admit alot better people.541,I think that abortion should be illegal because it hurts everyone. Someone could go an abort the kid they are having and it can hurt the male partner and family. It should not be allowed to be just the woman's decision544,If there were no police anybody could do what they wanted. They would not get into trouble. It would be a nightmare. we would have to go back to the wild west and pack guns545,I disagree with the concept of de-funding the police. It is such a difficult position and taking away resources will only make it worse. We need to put more money towards better training and strengthening those careers.553,I selected slightly opposing defunding the police. I think that this will create a vacuum in the public space that will be filled with criminals and crime. I do think that there needs to be a greater focus on mental health and providing those services to the people the police serve but getting rid of them entirely would lead to anarchy.555,The issue I select is defunding the police. All it will do is increase crime and increase violent death. New York became the safest city by increasing police presence.556,"I think vaccine mandates are unconstitutional. While they may be helpful in reducing the spread of viruses, the COVID vaccines are somewhat unproven. I don't think the government should mandate what I do with my body."557,"Affirmative action is, by definition, racist and it needs to go. If a person works hard to gain admission into college but is then rejected for being a certain race (usually Asian), then it is simply not fair. Why should someone who spends their whole life working to get into a good college be rejected on the basis of race? It's morally bereft."570,"Standardized tests- I had to complete the SAT, ACT, and GRE for my graduate program, which is occupational therapy. Testing me on my math and english skills really isn't related to anatomy, physiology, or kinesiology.  I also have ADD and cannot stand sitting for long periods of time, and all of these tests require you to sit still at a desk/table for multiple hours, which is not ideal whatsoever. Standardizing tests is ridiculous and I think should be abolished."572,Affirmative action should be dissolved because it unfairly treats others. The policy itself is racist and doesn't allow equal opportunity for everyone. This is why I hold my opinion575,"Affirmative action, I love the fact that this gets minorities jobs. But the problem is businesses hire people just satisfy affirmative action and turn away whites that ""may"" be more qualified than those hired.  This creates lower quality of workers less proficient products produced and society in general suffers."577,"I honestly thin that we should not defund the police, There is more crime and we need protection. The only way we can get it is having more police"580,When it comes to defunding the police I oppose that. the reason why I oppose that is because when it comes to policing I wanted to be as much police as possible so crimes can be eliminated and criminals can go to jail. if you defund the police that lowers the chance and resources of people in need getting help from the police.582,"My position about removing standardized tests is mostly neutral, maybe slightly against.  I haven't heard much about it recently, and no longer being a student it doesn't affect me.  I do remember what a pain it was to study for them and how websites wanted money from you to take practice tests etc.  It was a miserable experience to study for and then take the test for hours.  It also affects a student's self image depending on how well they do.
However, removing it would possibly allow people who aren't fit for college to apply.  Not that they're worth less, but because a college can only admit so many students at one time it is probably better to admit those who can both do well in academics and prove that they really want to be there by going through hardship to study."586,"When it comes to abortion, I feel like it is situational. It should be legal for the people that want it and the ones I don’t want to just don’t need to do it. It is especially important to have the option of abortion when you have some sort of medical reasons, such as the fetus is not alive anymore or other medical necessities. Also, if a person becomes pregnant from something tragic, such as rape, trafficking, abuse, then they should have the option as well."592,"Defunding the police was a cry set by people who wanted to tear down our society. There are bad cops, that's a fact and has been seen numerous times, but that is only a handful. Defunding the police doesn't solve that problem. Psychological evaluations for current officers as well as officers in training would be far more effective. They are not the bad guys, they catch the bad guys. They are public servants who are there to ""protect and serve."" With cutbacks jobs would be lossed, crime would go up and our streets would be less safe for our loved ones and ourselves. Yes some go on power trips, there is plenty of videos on that, there are also many more videos of police helping, and being all around good people to those in need. They save lives. They only use force when truly necessary. They are there for us in our time of need. Without them we would always have to live in fear that no one will come when we need them the most."597,If the police are defunded then there would be less police on the streets and crime would increase.  Large cities would become a free for all for criminals and people would be scared to live there.  People who could afford to would leave the city therby taking taxes away from the cities and the cities would spiral down the drain.606,"I'm strongly against mandating vaccines. I think you take away a person's freedom and right to choose what they think is best for them by mandating vaccines. When governments do this it's almost like communism. It's like Big Brother knows best, and honestly they don't always know best. This is the same government that thinks abortion is OK and homosexuality is fine when clearly it's not. To say I don't fully trust the government is an understatement."614,"Marijuana should be legalized across the US, for recreational use. The reasons for the government to outlaw it to begin with are ridiculous. It is a plant. All things in nature has some use. Marijuana is no different. Yes, people like to get high, but people can also use it for medicine for a variety of things. No one has ever died from smoking weed. Other illicit drugs are different. Some of them can be legalized, but only by prescription."633,Having worked in Human Resources for years my position is affirmative action as it exists is not effective. It sets up classes and boundaries and many qualified candidates are overlooked. It also puts managers in a place to fill quotas not hiring the best candidates. It also makes for a negative work situation. .638,Well I don't believe that abortion should be legal because I am a very religious person and I know that God is not okay with abortion. I do think that abortion is murder and it's taking the life of an innocent child who never even had the chance to choose between life and death. It is the same thing to me I was going out and killing someone if not worse. That is my stand on abortion I will never change my views on it I am definitely pro-life all the way and I don't understand people who think it's okay to go and do a sexual act and get pregnant but not have to take the responsibility for it. There are some cases however that should be excusable like if the baby in the mom's life is in danger and there is absolutely no way of carrying out the pregnancy without somebody dying. To me that is the only exception and only way that I would be okay with it.643,I don’t know why anyone would want to defund the police. We need the police to enforce law and order in order to live a peaceful existence. I would be very scared to live in a world where our police have been defunded. They do a hard job that a lot of people would not be willing to do. I don’t know very many people who would be willing to put their lives on the line for the pay that they get. If anything the police should be paid more. Anyone who thinks the police should be defunded is because they live a life of crime and not wanting to follow the rules.645,"I am strongly against abortion because I believe that life begins at conception and that any circumstance, except for the life of the mother, should be less important and less valuable than the life growing inside a mother."648,I am pro-life because of my religious beliefs. I am Roman Catholic and the Church does not support abortion. It supports mothers in need and finds them services and assistance.651,"I choose abortion. It hurts me deeply that the pro-life position even needs to be ""explained."" I mean, why is it wrong to kill an unborn baby?? Seriously?? I know cases of rape, incest, or mother's life in danger are instantly dragged out. Those are rare, isolated cases, and yes, there ARE children born from rape whose mother's have chosen life. Don't want the baby - give them up for adoption, but DON'T KILL! Now they are legalizing ""post-birth abortion."" Do I need to even comment on that?? SICKENING!!"653,We should not defund police. It will let crime run rampant. No one to help you when you are in danger. Criminals will take over.659,"I will talk about the vaccine mandate and how I feel about it. I don’t think that a vaccine should ever be mandated. I think that it’s my body and I should have the choice to do what I want with it and particularly in recent times with Covid, and this vaccine that got created in a very short period of time and basically got use on the public as a rat experiment is a perfect example of why I don’t agree with a vaccine mandate. My own mother got the Covid vaccine and she has had several side effects from it, including being sent to the hospital because her blood platelet levels dropped to zero. The doctors ran every test possible on her and the only conclusion they could come up with was it was a side effect from the vaccine she received a few days before, the only reason my mom got that vaccine is because she needed it to leave out of the country. It was a requirement and because of that she almost lost her life and she is still dealing with multiple side effects. After doing research about the particular Covid vaccine that she took, there are several studies now showing this happening in women her age and there’s nothing she can do about it because the companies are protected from being sued. The problem she’s having now are very worrisome and she’s only 55 years old.  This is a prime example of why I don’t believe vaccine should be mandated."682,I am for not defunding the police. They need to keep it as is. I think police do a good job and the good ones do not deserve to be punished687,Abortion should be the parents decision. If they cannot raise the child then let them abort it689,"Because I am a Christian and take the Bible as God’s promises and truths, I follow what is written.  Thou shall not kill."692,I think illegal drugs should not be legalized. There is no reason for illegal drugs besides marijuana should ever be considered to be legal. Illegal drugs pose dangers to the users and society as some illegal drugs can change people’s personalities and perceptions. I think crime would increase if drugs were to become legal.693,I feel that vaccines should not be mandated. The reason I feel this way is because I live in America and I thought I have freedom to choose. I have seen people get the vaccine and still get sick and die. So I do not believe that these vaccines should become law for the American people or any peoples in this world.697,"I am pro abortion legality. As a woman, I am the only one that has the right what to decide about my body. If I do abortion, it is my only conscience and no one else. I am the only one that will carry the consequence of having an abortion."698,It woukd be legalizing marajuana i feel it aids people who suffer mentally.700,"Abortion being illegal. I am pro life. I think it is wrong to kill an unborn child, but not because I am religious. I am okay with abortion being legal for people who have become pregnant from rape, incest, or if it saves a mother. In those extreme cases, or maybe even if the child will have extensive difficulties surviving. Otherwise, it should be illegal. It just seems ridiculous people can commit legal murder because they couldn't control their ability to have sex or at least use protection... I feel we remove accountability by making it legal."723,Defunding the police is a bad idea. There is already a shortage for first responders and to take away the funding only puts more work on an already over worked group.724,"the abortion question.
I think that everyone has the right to manage their own body. What if a woman was raped and became pregnant. Who can force her to give birth to a child if she does not want it"725,I hold the opinion of no vaccine mandates because it forces people to have to take it when they don't want to such as for a job or school.729,"I definitely oppose mandatory vaccinations now more than I used to because it revolves around COVID and there have been many studies and people coming out saying that the vaccination has been rushed and too many sketchy things. I think that is why it needs to be the people's choice on whether or not they want to get it. To have your life threatened if you don't get a certain vaccine is unconstitutional. And not everyone can medically receive vaccines, and no one should harass others on whether or not they have received it. Now, I understand how you can't go to other countries in place"731,"I do not think the police should be defunded.  People need a police force to protect them.  They need to know  the police are there in case they need to call them. 
Crime would be worse if the police were defunded.  Criminals would take over and do whatever they wanted to do. 
Citizens need to know the police will protect them.  They need to live in a safe environment."732,"I believe that all drugs should be legalized. The war on drugs costs the United States million per year possibly billions of dollars of chasing down things that are grown on earth. We should decriminalize these products, and regulate them for sale. People are capable of making their own choices and have their own vices so it would be best to reduce the amount of public waste trying to crack down on drugs causes."733,"Defunding the police is a stupid idea, as it does not solves anything. And just creates more crime and tougher on the cops that actually do good justice. People who want to defund the police just want to get away with crimes"739,I am firmly against defunding the police. As it is more departments are struggling with staffing and equipment defunding would only weaken them more and make it harder to respond to citizens in a reasonable period of time749,"I do not believe in legal abortions because it goes against God's will. I believe a woman should have a baby that has been conceived unless the pregnancy is going to cause death to the mother. If a mother does not want the child, there are so many woman that cannot have children that would love to adopt and give a child a loving home."750,"I think the police should not be defunded, but rather be further funded. I believe this because even Democrat Gavin Newsom admitted that there is a shortage of police officers. A police officer is someone who protects the people by stopping dangerous people when they're committing crime. If police were to be defunded, there would be more crime and violence. In fact, police officers are a type of ""peace officer."" Without these peace officers, there would be less peace."756,"Affirmative action is a bad idea in the sense that we should not as a society consider race as a factor in selecting college applicants or potential hires, which is an inherently racist notion. We should only consider the best. Despite any notion of social insufficiency or disadvantage, if one was suited to the position they strive for or intelligent enough to get into a prestigious school, they should be recognized entirely for their natural or honed abilities and mental faculties, because that is the only thing that should matter."758,"Defunding the police, I think it's bad because crime is up and the police need all the help they can get."761,"I'll go with legalized drugs. First of all, I think drugs like pot and edibles are perfectly fine. However, if drugs like heroine; cocaine and methamphetamines were to become legal, there would be a surge of overdoses and the crime rate would skyrocket overnight. It would be a social disaster."762,"I strongly believe that abortion should be illegal in this country. No matter how you look at the situation, the bottom line is, abortion is murder. If abortions were to be legal in this country, I feel too many women/men would feel it’s okay to have unprotected sex because they can always get an abortion if they were to get pregnant."763,Defunding the Police - I tend to slightly agree with defunding the police but not in the terms of all or nothing. I want a more professional national training implemented with layoffs across Police Stations especially Large Cities like New York for example. There's simply too much corruption.775,"I have chosen the legalization of illicit drugs. I believe they should be fully legalized, regulated, and properly taxed like any other prescription. My view is largely biased by spite for cartels and other such organizations and their inhumane practices; legalization and stateside production would mean less money to them."777,I think affirmative action was a bad idea.781,"I believe standardized testing should be removed from schools. The reason for this is because not everybody learns the same. Basically as it stands, kids are being taught to memorize what’s important to pass the test so that schools get good ratings. A schools rating may be important, but it is not more important than kids actually learning and not just memorizing."784,"Legalization of drugs.
There are many health benefits to people that suffer from numerous diseases that can benefit from certain drugs. Microdosing has been studied and shown to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Marijuana has been shown to releave symptoms of pain, help with anxiety, lessen the side effects of Chron's disease."788,"Abortion is a big issue with me. There are some instances such as rape, incest, mother could die, etc where I believe there is a reason. Most people don't want a baby so go get an abortion. They use it for birth control even tho they knew what would happen when they had sex. 1 time is all it takes to get pregnant and that baby did nothing wrong to deserve to die. People want to say it's a clump of cells. It is but it also has a heartbeat. It can move and grow and think. Would you kill a litter of puppies because they are unwanted? No because you would give them away."789,Vaccines help protect people from getting ill from the virus795,I believe the police should not be refunded. Criminals will take advantage of the situation. We actually need more police..
