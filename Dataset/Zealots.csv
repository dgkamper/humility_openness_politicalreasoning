9,"For mandatory vaccines, I hold this position because I think it's important to keep yourself and others healthy. While I believe in self-determination, I also believe that lots of people don't take the time to become educated on topics. However, mandatory vaccines can infringe on religious beliefs, which is complicated. I personally think mandatory vaccines should be implicated because one's decision whether or not to get a vaccine affects other people's health as well.",2,zealots
11,"Personally, I am in agreement with standardized testing to be removed from school. In my experience, I took the SAT and I didn‚Äôt even decide to go to a university, I just went to community college. In my case, I didn‚Äôt even need to spend the money to take the SAT just to go to another four years of schooling. So, I don‚Äôt oppose the idea of removing standardized testing.",2,zealots
16,I oppose defunding the police because I feel it will negativity affect socitity. Defunding the police would increase criminal and violence activity. Cops should be held accountable if they do something wrong but the whole department should not be affected.,2,zealots
21,"I think most drugs should be decriminalized. I think it would help prevent unnecessary crime related to the underground trafficking of drugs. It would also give people more freedom to do what they want in their downtime. I don't think it would lead to more people abusing hard drugs, as those people find a way if they want to",2,zealots
27,"Mandatory vaccines.
It makes sense to mandate vaccines. They work. They prevent illness. They help our society grow.",2,zealots
31,"I don't feel affirmative action is effective. The policy of affirmative action is intended to improve the fairness of hiring practices by enforcing diversity. However, enforcing diversity inversely decreases hiring fairness, as folks are not hired for their worth to the company, rather, a statistic to meet diversity requirements. Additionally, it further promotes anger and bigotry, as certain people are treated differently from others.",2,zealots
59,Abortion. Women should be able to make decisions about their body.,2,zealots
64,"I think the police should be defunded because they're given way too much money. I don't have the evidence right in front of me, but I have seen studies that show allocating police funds into other programs like social welfare, public schools, etc. actually do more to improve crime rates than giving more money to the police.",2,zealots
78,Abortion is murder. Killing babies is always wrong. Even if they think it may endanger the mother to have the baby. Only God knows for sure what will happen to the mother. He will spare both her's and the baby's life. He is a wonderful God!,2,zealots
83,"I think affirmative action is an outdated relic from an oppressive time that did not give chances fairly. Now, practically anyone can claim this status, which makes it practically useless at best, and insulting at worst. Also, it is diverse on the surface only, as there is no guarantee that diversity of skin tone equates to diversity of thought",2,zealots
87,"Abortion is a complicated subject because there are situations where it is understandable to have an abortion. I was molested when I was younger and if I had gotten pregnant, I would not want to raise his child. It would be incest as well as having to be reminded of that experience every day. However, I can't get past the fact that you are killing a human being. If a murderer kills a pregnant woman, they are charged for double murder. So how come abortion isn't the same thing? I am completely conflicted over this issue.",2,zealots
94,"I believe that abortions should be legal because they are beneficial to women's health needs. Medical abortions are often needed due to issues with the pregnancy. If the baby cannot be safely carried to term, the mother's shouldn't be afraid to medically terminate their pregnancy. There are also cases of rape victims that don't wish to continue carrying the child of their attacker. Ultimately, the decision should fall to the pregnant women whose lives will be altered by the pregnancy. Making abortions illegal doesn't stop them from occurring. It just limits the safe options.",2,zealots
103,"I believe that abortion should be legal, because it is up to a women if she wants one or not. No you can tell her want to do with her body. Just like Republicans argument on vaccine, my body my choice.",2,zealots
104,"I believe abortion is health care and is a woman‚Äôs right. Making abortion illegal not only just stops access to safe abortions, but infringes on reproductive care. If we don‚Äôt force men to abide by certain body laws, we shouldn‚Äôt expect the same of women.",2,zealots
105,"All drugs should be legalized and regulated. All of them. From heroin to MDMA, there is no drug more deadly than alcohol, no drug more addictive than sugar, and no drug more prevalent than caffeine, and all are legal. But all other substances are demonized and called ""dangerous."" They are illegal not for scientific reasons, but for political ones. Regan started his drug war to demonize black people and yet the CIA brought cocaine into the inner cities and started making crack, making one of the most expensive drugs cheap and easily available. Which was a way to incarcerate black and low income people. It's all a scam. It's all a lie. MDMA can CURE PTSD with proper therapy. Ketamine has saved my life multiple times, it is an AMAZING antidepressant. I'm not even going to talk about weed, since it's so safe, it's not worth discussing. Mushrooms and LSD are also powerful medicines. And if someone wants to take heroin, after learning about it, they should be able to do so legally, with clean needles, and with the right dose. No one should be able to decide what drug I can and cannot do. Old white rich uneducated white men who make the laws know nothing of neurosciences or pharmacology, yet they decide LSD is schedule I, along with heroin with ""no medical usage."" Bullshit.",2,zealots
111,I think vaccines should be mandatory because of the health effects and immunity they bring to the people and the community around them. The side effects for the people that get them are so small compared to the amount of people that receive the benefits.,2,zealots
116,I think standard tests are trying to do something good but there are a lot of barriers to them fulfilling their promise. First off not all students do well on tests. Students learn differently and some do well at taking tests and others do not. Students that have more money are able to get access to classes and tutors to help them do better whereas poorer students might not have the resources.,2,zealots
117,I think abortion should be legal because people should have the right and free will to do what they please with there specimens. Some people cannot afford to have babies but were just engaging in something very casual that can spin out of hand. this can set many people back and change the trajectory of their lives.,2,zealots
119,I am against vaccine mandates because my niece stopped breathing after her 4 month shots and my kids sibling started having seizures after her 12 month shots. I don't think everyone should get shots as you never know how ones body would react to the toxic ingredients. It should be up to each person and how they feel about vaccines,2,zealots
120,Illegal drugs making it illegal. I am totally against this because I believe so many precious lives will be able to get these drugs so much easier.,2,zealots
136,"Abortion should be legal in all 50 states. I firmly believe a woman should have the right to choose whether or not she carryout a pregnancy. It makes no difference if the pregnancy is a result of rape, or a married couple conceiving. It should not be a decision for policy makers, religious leaders, or anyone who aims to force an unwanted pregnancy on a woman.",2,zealots
143,"Abortion -  Because I'm female and I had an abortion when I was a teenager, 15 years old. I was at a family member's house and they were having a party. Some of their less-known guests drugged me and I was raped by one of the men. I was completely alone and didn't receive much support or understanding, and I didn't even know what was changing with my body because I would have never chosen to be abused and become pregnant. If it were forced upon me, that I must follow through with the pregnancy, I would have had a much different life, not necessarily for the better.  I wasn't able to take care of myself on my own then, and it would be inhumane to have a child and perpetuate the same situation.",2,zealots
147,"I think that ACT tests should not be the only part of submission because that doesn't say anything about you as a student, they should rather take into account your academic performance as a whole and judge your character.",2,zealots
149,"The issue I choose is abortion. I believe that abortion should be between a woman and her doctor and no one else. I think that current laws are sexist and misogynistic as well as bad for society as a whole. Women are happier and more successful as a whole when they have access to abortion, and abortion is, in my opinion, necessary for an equal society. All abortion should be legal, even late-term, and minors should be able to get abortions without parental approval. I believe this because I think no woman should have to be pregnant if she does not want to. It is a bodily autonomy issue.",2,zealots
154,Vaccine mandate - I support because it could lower risk for all.,2,zealots
157,"One of the issues I was presented with I support is that of defunding the police.  While I do not feel all cops are bad, I also do not feel cops should hold all the roles they do.  Cops shouldn't be expected to go after criminals and also be mental health therapists.  Police need to focus on what they do best and that is preventing crime.  We need social workers on the force to go to or backup police on situations in which it's about something dealing with mental health.  In these situations we shouldn't be quick to arrest, but rather try to help.  This is why I stand with the defunding the police movement because I do not like the idea of police having to essentially wear multiple hats being not only a cop, but a psychologist as well.  They're simply not trained nor educated enough to handle all these roles.  They should fight crime, and leave the rest to trained professionals who would be better at handling situations such as a mental breakdown or drug intervention.",2,zealots
163,"Legal Drugs: The best way to take the hands of organized crime and drug cartels out of the way of doing things and filling their hands with money illegally, allowing some drugs to be grown legally by farmers in our state, and our certified laboratories to supply some recreational drugs safely, while at the same time eliminating crime in the streets by the illicit sale of narcotics and the transport of drugs illegally through airports and other means.",2,zealots
164,"No one with common sense should defund the police. It is one of the most stupidest things, I have heard in a while. Sounds like a liberal utopia, where they can go around and commit crimes. They lack their logic and only fall under the echo chambers of sheer stupidity from main stream media. Are they corruption in police departments? Of course. But they also massive corruption in politics and no one is going on to defund the government.",2,zealots
182,"The issue I will choose is legalizing abortion. My opinion is that it is an individual's choice on what they want to do with their body and if they have to have a pregnancy or not. Being pregnant should not be a punishment for having sex, and we have the medical technology and pills to safely abort babies, so we should use them.",2,zealots
188,"I feel all drugs should be legalized and regulated by the government. This would allow safer access for people who are going to use drugs anyway and reduce the risks and deaths associated by doing illegal, shady transactions with strangers/drug dealers who do not have the best intentions. This provides pure drugs vs something potentially laced with something lethal. It gives the opportunity for a controlled, safe environment to use these substances in. It reduces the stigma associated with illegal drug use and treats it as a health issue which would allow more resources available to accept and treat said health issues. I forget which country has already done it, but one has and its been more successful than not. It also brings more money and resources in to the government, hopefully to the states. It's good for all levels from the citizen to the federal government to treat it as a health issue and not something criminal. It should be regulated like alcohol.",2,zealots
194,"Abortion should be legal in all states, in all cases, zero exceptions, up to the moment of birth. Women and other people with the ability to become pregnant have many complicated reasons for receiving abortions, none of which should be controlled by the state at all. Some women don't want to be pregnant, some don't want a baby, some are at risk of health complications, some do not have health insurance, etc. There are zero wrong reasons for wanting an abortion, and until that fetus is out of it's mother, it is a parasitic growth with no rights of it's own and should be treated as such. Women have less bodily autonomy than a corpse, because even a person before death is able to choose whether or not their organs are donated, but now a woman must donate her body by law to a thing that is not even a person yet. Anyone against abortion is against women's rights, and does not care if women live or die.",2,zealots
201,I have been a drug addict and still am who was addicted to heroine.  Sometimes getting heroine can put you in dangerous situations and you don‚Äôt know what your getting.  People rob and steal for these drugs and use dirty needles.  Getting myself in the methadone clinic saved my life.  I have been clean for 3 years.  To have places like that for addicts where they can safely get the drugs they need and they help would be better than putting these people in prison.  At the methadone clinic they just don‚Äôt hand me drugs.  I go to many counseling appointments and am seen by a doctor on a regular basis.  This kind of system with drugs would only benefit.,2,zealots
204,Drugs should not be legalized because they are dangerous and cause people to make dangerous and wrong choices. This will lead to crime and dangerous situations within everbodys community.,2,zealots
214,"I am a biologically female person who has had an abortion. It is an important issue to me because women should never under any circumstances be told what to do with their own bodies. Men would never have such laws applied to them, they suffer no consequences when they had equal part in the act. Religious concerns should NEVER EVER be used as an argument when there is supposed to be separation of church and state in this country.",2,zealots
215,"(I want to state here that I am not for abortion being illegal, I think I may have answered that one incorrectly based on confusion with how it was worded.)

Every female should have the ability to choose what is best for herself and her body when it comes to having a baby. Abortion should not be illegal. Abortions being illegal harms victims of rape and incest. It harms unwanted children and burdens foster care families. It forces children to be born into homelessness, drug use, mental health issues, etc, that could be avoided given a woman's ability to choose.

Abortions being illegal also make it harder for women who are experiencing unsafe pregnancies or unviable pregnancies to get the care that they require. It puts women's lives at risk.",2,zealots
217,I am a strong believer that abortion should be legal in all instances and should be supported financially by the federal government. Access to an abortion is crucial for women regardless of the reason.,2,zealots
222,"Affirmative action goes against the very thing it says it stands for. It is supposed to be giving those once discriminated against an advantage over others. This in and of itself is discriminatory to all those others. So are we saying it's the ""others"" turn to be discriminated against? Is that OK? Affirmative action is being judged by the color of your skin. Isn't that racist? Why don't we just eliminate race and skin color all together from applications? Why can't we just pick based on hard work and merit? Isn't that the fairest way? One can't help what color they were born as. But they can help how hard they work for something.",2,zealots
231,"abortion:

232,"Drugs have been criminalized for too long, there are drugs that hurt no one and should be legal.",2,zealots
234,"I fully support legalizing abortion because women should be able to do what they want with their bodies. It is nobody elses business. Some women have complicated pregnancies, some women get raped, and unfortunately some of those are young girls. It is a shame people would want to withhold that freedom of choice from them and run higher risks.",2,zealots
243,"SAT/ACT. I work at a college and I think the SAT/ACT can be improved, or adjusted, but still think the objective external scores are valuable to make decisions about entry. Especially for remedial classes and getting students into the right content area. Without SAT/ACT students are not placed correctly, or the schools needs to have more placement and testing at the school to determine which basic classes the students can start with during their freshman year. Students are extremely underprepared for college academically and do not have some of the needed academic ability and SAT/ACT, while not perfect can help identify students who need a bit more assistance early in college if done correctly.",2,zealots
254,"I choose mandated vaccines. It is nobodies business, especially the government, to decide what I put in my body. Perhaps if the vaccine was proven to reduce the spread of Covid I would feel differently, but right now it is not. I have watched family members get boosters and become very sick with Covid, yet I have not gotten one shot and have not gotten sick at all. A medical decision is nobodies choice but the patient.",2,zealots
255,"I agree with the legalization of illicit drugs, because I believe it would spur more honest conversations about the reality of addictions. And it would cause more mental health, resources, community resources, treatment, centers, and more resources for families and single parents, struggling with addictions. And minors in those in compromised and unsafe situations. The drug issue is a mental health issue, and if it was viewed as a mental health issue and I was something we could help as a community. It wouldn‚Äôt be viewed as an choice or a moral fault.",2,zealots
257,"I think there needs to be a federal bill supporting abortion. Women are not the property of the federal government, so they should get to make their own decisions.",2,zealots
258,"I am strongly against banning abortion because access to abortion is essential for people's health and well-being. For example- if abortion is banned except in cases of death of the mother, a miscarriage could mean the end of a woman's life because the line between certain death and possible death can be unclear or impossible to prove. Finding a doctor willing to risk losing their license or imprisonment will be extremely difficult. There are so many scenarios that make banning abortion the opposite of a pro-life position.",2,zealots
263,"I am for the most against legalization of illicit drugs. The main reason is the devastating physical, mental, and emotional effects on individuals who become involved with or addicted to these powerful drugs. It's important that society has some standards and guides for wellbeing of individuals. There really is no argument that illicit drugs are beneficial for one. Legalizing them is an admission of utter defeat, not a measure for benefiting anyone or admitting that illicit drugs are not harmful, that society was mistaken about the harm they cause.",2,zealots
264,"Abortion should be a choice for rape victims, incest victims, and health to the mother.  Now there will be more females getting illegal abortions which could be dangerous.  A 13 year old should not be forced to carry a child if they were raped.  Or any female for that matter. If the mother has health issues that could kill her having a child that should be a choice.  There will be so many more people that will be in the system because they can not afford a child. I remember the pain of being pregnant and giving birth.  I don't think anyone should be forced to go through that if it is not wanted.   I do think there should be a term limit though.",2,zealots
274,I believe abortion shouldn't be the subject of the court or law at all. Abortion is medical care and should be protected like all other privacy issues. It should be between a woman and her doctor. Period. To use a religious/Christian dogma to determine an individual woman's medical decisions is dangerous. Church/State separate in all things.,2,zealots
278,"I write for a vaccine mandate since Covid was a severe issue that took many, many lives of the young, old, and the middle with hospitals being filled with patients. It was terrible, too many deaths could have been prevented if somehow the mandate was sooner and more in supply. people were against it despite the high number of deaths, it was saddening to see how many people have passed away.",2,zealots
279,"I've known people to get severely injured, harassed, and even lose their life in the pursuit of a safe termination to their pregnancy. Abortion NEEDS to be accessible.",2,zealots
296,"The issue I would choose to talk about is the legalization of illicit substances as it is the topic I am most familiar with and a topic that I have written papers on before. The first point of discussion is that the general sentiment towards the legalization of certain licit substances is only a matter of time. On the state level there are many states that are reforming their drug policy much to the benefit of their communities, the people living in these communities, and the police in charge of protecting these communities. Marijuana for example which is still a schedule one drug federally has been introduced for both medical and recreational use. In the states that have legalized Marijuana for medical and recreational use teen drug usage has decreased. While community outreach and other social and health service programs have been established with the tax revue generated from the sale of Marijuana. This is just one example of the many different licit substances that could be legalized for both recreational or medical use to provide benefits to the community. Rather then fund the illegal usage and selling of these substances by criminal elements that line their own pocket and put the health and safety of the community at risk as seen with the increase of fentanyl deaths happening as of recent.",2,zealots
298,"I've been a proponent for drug legalization for decades... long before legalizing marijuana gained any traction in general conversations! The funny thing is that I don't do drugs. Still, humans have been finding ways to get high and escape life for a little while since the first fig fermented, so why not a) make it safe, b) make it quality controlled for safety, c) provide specific places it's legal, and d) tax it like any other business to help our communities and states.

While we're at it - sex work should also be legalized, regulated, and taxed. These are things that people have always done and will ALWAYS do. The puritanical right refuses to accept these truths of humanity. Thus we have overflowing prisons, crime, and abused people of all types.",2,zealots
308,"I do not believe in affirmative action. I believe that the most qualified students should be rewarded for the hard work, good grades etc. Letting a certain number of individuals into college or work because they are black is a scary thing. Some of these people may not be qualified to do the job. They got in on their skin color not their skill. Whether white or black or any color this should scare everyone. Giving someone something special because of their skin color is called racism. Why do we think this is okay for blacks but blacks cry racism if they think whites are getting the privileges? I know many white people who are underprivileged as well and can barely pay their bills. They aren't getting any special favors. To act like whites have it made and don't suffer is outrageous. Some of the richest people on earth are black.",2,zealots
315,"I think affirmative action helps people, it gives minorities a chance and makes things not based on nepotism.",2,zealots
316,"I am anti-abortion because I truly believe abortion is murder. Abortion is the intentional killing of another human being who is not yet born (a fetus). Abortion is not healthcare. People who argue that they should not have to carry a fetus are neglecting two things: 1. that fetus is a child (not a clump of cells) and 2. they did the action to create the child. People should be held accountable for their own decisions. Others may claim that there should be exceptions in the case of rape or the life of the mother. I have two things to say about this. In regards to rape, two wrongs do not make a right. I am sorry to people who were raped, and I hope the perpetrator is brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. However, you cannot choose to murder someone else. That child is innocent and deserves a chance at life. Second, in the case of the mother's health (not mental health but true dire physical health), this situation is not classified as abortion. People have not done their research because terminating a life to save the life of the mother is not classified as abortion. Now there are situations like Chrissy Teigen brought up where they killed their child because ""the child would not survive outside of the womb."" This does not affect her health at all. I believe in miracles, and this was truly evil.",2,zealots

322,"I will write about my position on abortion. i strongly support abortion and am pro-choice. Why i hold this view is because a clump of cells inside a person's organs is not a human, but a person who is able to get pregnant IS a human. By making abortion illegal, you are taking away bodily autonomy from humans and commiting a human rights violation and an act of war. It is morally inhumane to force people to conveice and bear children. Not only does it harm the people forced to have children, but it harms everybody involved, including the children. Making abortion illegal will result in endless tragedies and horrors, including people dying from trying to perform them illegally because by making them illegal you make them unsafe and dangerous. Abortions will NOT stop occuring, they will only become unsafe and result in countless fatalities and injuries and suffering. It will also criminilize people who have had to make one of the hardest decisions of their life. Nobody wants to have to go through abortion. This process is already painful enough for a person to go through, criminlizing them for it is unbelivably inhumane it astounds me anybody could possibly support making abortion illegal. 

Making it illegal would also result in a drastic increase of unwanted children being born, which would then both put a heavy strain on the already flawed foster care system, as well as result in increase in child abuse and neglect in the homes of parents who cannot care for their unwanted children. Abuse, including sexual abuse, is extremely common in foster homes, so there would be an increase in all of that as well, causing an increase in severe trauma related illness in kids and mental health problems. I coud honestly go on about this for hours, but i'll stop here because i've already said quite a bit. I feel very strongly about this issue and the right to abortion and bodily autonomy.

324,"I feel that abortion should be legalized because it's a woman's right to have control over her own body. To no allow a woman choices over her own body is insane to think about and it's even more insane that Roe Vs Wade was actually overturned. Taking away abortions is not going to help anymore, it will help to more issues in the long term. I heard a politician talk about abortions' and he said under any circumstance an abortion should be illegal, even if the woman is raped. He also said they are planning to push for abortion to be illegal under all circumstances. It made me very angry and frustrated to hear that because something that is force upon a woman and than leads to consequences is morally wrong. A woman deserves the right to decide if she keeps a baby or not. I think more unwanted children will start filling up foster care and orphanages. These children will have life long issues from the shift of being placed into multiple different foster homes if they are not adopted into a loving family.",2,zealots

346,"I'll write about vaccine mandates. I am completely against mandates. There is no pandemic that causes a major threat to human life nor has there been since the idea of ""vaccine mandates"" became a reality. There also doesn't seem to be any contagious disease on the horizon that threatens life on a mass scale. Lastly, the government has no right to insist that any human undergo a medical treatment. When such a basic right as one's own body is taken away from a person, that is a violation of their most fundamental right, and all other rights are at risk for government control. A perfect example for all of the above is the mandates that were put in place for COVID-19, mandating untested, ineffective, potentially lethal vaccines that only served to deprive people of their jobs, their livelihoods, their recreation, including travel and entertainment, and promoted social division.",2,zealots
347,"The abortion issue is a philosophically dense one. Depending on who you're talking to, it can divulge into hours long conversations about the ontology of human life and existence in general. Under our current philosophical framework in the west, it's my opinion that it's illogical to maintain that abortion should be legalized. This raises another point. Asking whether abortion should be LEGALIZED isn't equivalent to asking whether abortion is MORAL. 

I'll answer the question as to why I think abortion shouldn't be legalized. Let's start with some axioms we generally believe here in the west. Unprovoked homicide ought to be avoided. In other words, killing another human isn't acceptable without an amalgam of factors proving it's justification. So why then, should a woman be allowed to terminate the human life developing in her womb. Perhaps it's not a human life. Why? What defines a human life? What I've found is that any arbitrary line you attempt to draw which demarcates ""human life"", can very simply be disproven by a counterexample which we would all agree is definitely human life. The only logically consistent basis I've come to reason with, is conception. At conception an entirely unique genetic code is formed form the unique synthesis of the egg and sperm. Barring few exceptions, it's my belief that we ought to uphold the rights of that life.",2,zealots

361,"I believe in legalizing illicit substances. The War on Drugs not only failed in its mission, but prevented many substances with possible medical uses from being explored. Its only success has been putting thousands of non-violent offenders in prison for the crime of... doing something to themselves? The government can stay out of our personal lives. If someone is not infringing on another's constitutional or civil rights, the government has no right to impose its morals upon that citizen.",2,zealots

If you won't voluntarily help your fellow humans, then maybe you need to be forced into it.

366,Defunding the police is a poorly worded tagline. We need to reallocate funds to mental health services. We need to lift people out of poverty. Reallocate funds to update our school environments. Give training to the police to non-violent escalation. Too much money is used to militarize our police force but little training in how to deal with actual people of the community. The police are getting off the hook to easily with murder and there is a culture of violence that needs to be examined before we continue flooding them with money.,2,zealots
367,"I will choose the topic of legalizing all illicit drugs since that is the way the question was framed. First, I dont believe all drugs have the potential for the same harm and should not be all classified the same under the law. Many people are incarcerated for possession of an illicit substance, for example marijuana, and are then introduced into the prison system. These same people are then more likely to commit other offenses and be re-incarcerated. They are discriminated against when exiting prison and have difficulty establishing a working life. Everything is much harder for people who have been imprisoned and when the reason for their imprisonment is something that should not be a crime the fact is more egregious.
There should be different penalties for possession vs intent to sell, which there is already established, but not always enforced fairly. There are some drugs that I do not believe should be legalized as they are far too dangerous to society. They destroy families and an individual's health and ambitions. They are most often addictive in nature and most humans have a huge mountain of difficulty in freeing themselves from addiction, a reality which affects a person's entire life span and can negatively impact generations of people surrounding that individual. Legalization of illicit substances like opiates creates a class who is addictive and is unproductive, people who then turn to crime to support their addictive habit. Legalization of other types of drugs could mean many more people traffic the substances making them much more available to society at every age level. The idea is destructive to society, endangering the lives of children and others who arent well educated on the subject or have mental/emotional problems, seek escape or suicide.",2,zealots
373,"I feel very strongly about the removal of standardized testing because nobody on this planet is standardized--especially not people with any kind of learning or developmental disability. We are so focused, in American schools, on memorization and drilling for tests that we tend to learn very little. School should be about learning, not about preparing for tests or gaining credits. There are few occupations where you are expected to have all of your information memorized, and are not allowed to keep notes, check ""the book,"" or ask others for help, so we should focus our schooling on HOW to learn; how to take notes; how to check your references. The results of other countries following this method speaks for itself.",2,zealots

The chances of someone who uses illicit drugs becoming a productive member of society are reduced, and I believe illicit drugs are bad for your health and can lead to premature death",2,zealots

They are using their religious reasons to hide behind their hate, as well as manipulating their constituents into voting for them.  They are power hungry and do not care about anything other than votes, power, and money. They are using God as tool for their greed and lust for piety, all while preaching to others about how to be righteous and God fearing.

I personally do not agree with abortion myself (unless medically necessary), but I agree with it being the right of women to chose to have an abortion or not.  I have never met someone who wanted an abortion, but I have met many women who are not prepared mentally, financially, or who have no support system at all other than welfare programs to help them raise the child.  The problem is that these pious politicians and their voters stop caring about that child once the child is born and then attack the mother's dependence on welfare programs and possibly criminal activity as a means to keep their voter's in a hate fueled cycle that never ends.

Yet, the evidence clearly outweighs the reasons that the vaccines are a positive thing in this instance. There are more deaths and adverse reactions happening still daily. The statistics showing the lives that are being saved are ridiculously low compared to the data showing they are doing more harm. When any of this is mentioned, we are made to look like fools-rebel non-vaxxers who are Trump supporters and treasonous terrorists who just want to be famous on social media. That is not who I am. I am someone who thinks logically before allowing my family any harm. I am not distrusting so much as one who likes to do her own due diligence regarding matters of importance. I am definitely someone who opposes anyone or thing that demands me to do something I do not want to do. I have done in depth research regarding this topic and regardless of how I personally feel towards the topic, I have to consider everything that is available to me and would rather (much rather in this instance) be wrong and apologize than see my findings be the cause for any harm being done to anyone. 
Fact is, everywhere I look, there is more evidence opposing that of what is being shown on MSM. It is obvious to me that there is criminal sabotage going on in places that should be protecting our citizens to the level of treason I would never have considered possible, even in a book of fiction previously.

395,"Although I understand the argument behind affirmative action and am sympathetic to the sentiments behind it, I am nonetheless against the practice. First, as far as I know, affirmative action is a practice that has largely been implemented to level the playing field vis-a-vis the axis of race and to a lesser degree gender. Yet inequality exists along many other axes like sexuality, socioeconomic class, immigration status, and so on.  I think that society should help all those who face inequality and injustice, but the difficult part is how to spread the resources among those groups. I think affirmative action bestows a privilege on certain groups at the expense of other marginalized groups, and in doing so, it creates a tremendous amount of resentment. Second, I think that the fundamental problem in society is not that marginalized groups are not able to get into college as compared to other groups. Instead, the real problem is the poverty and mediocre education systems within the communities of the marginalized groups.  In my opinion, affirmative action is like giving a person a life vest to a person whose home floods twice a month. It's helpful, but the life vest does nothing to address the flooding. In the end, I do not support affirmative action because I think it's unfair to other marginalized groups, does not address the fundamental problem, and creates a tremendous amount of resentment within society.",2,zealots

People forget that women can be raped or lied to about contraception, which means that it is not their choice or fault for being pregnant. They also forget that there are complications to pregnancy that can cause birth to kill the mother. It does not make sense that people wanting to prevent abortion say they care about the child, because they give no consideration to whether the women giving birth.

This doesn't even begin to touch on external circumstances that would make abortion an otherwise logical choice, such as rape, incest, pregnancy of a minor, or the health and life of the mother and/or fetus at stake.

For instance, a student with exceptional grades and extra curricular activities may not have a test score that accurately shows their skill OR drive. This could result in loss of scholarships that would have afforded an opportunity at higher education.

Decriminalization will also allow authorities to redirect resources towards other crime that may benefit the public more.

I always worked at least 20 hours a week since I was 15 and still got excellent grades.  I went on to work in a Wall Street firm.

I was forced to bring a child into a broken home and ended up losing custody on accident when I signed paperwork for him to be on his father's parents' insurance plan, which was and is still very traumatic. My illnesses (endometriosis, adenomyosis) got worse and my overall well-being and quality of life diminished. I am still living in poverty and a lot of the opportunities I had to work and go to college were stripped away from me. 

Since men have the choice to put their penis inside women, women should also have the choice to abort a cluster of cells that will eventually grow into a living behing that has astronomical financial, emotional, and physical needs, often forcing them to be a single parent and rely on things like WIC, food stamps, welfare, etc. The choice of whether or not to give birth soley relies on the man with a penis. If he kept his penis out of a woman, there would be no chance of her getting pregnant.

In addition to that, many women are raped and are forced to give birth. Who would want to grow up knowing that they were the result of a life-long traumatic experience? Women who are raped should not be forced to give birth - they should have the option to abort. Especially things like incestual rape, which will result in a human being with disabilities due to the incest. Not only that, but the child will grow up knowing that they were conceived in a disgusting and disturbing way.

This is how diseases are controlled and eradicated - they require population level solutions, and thus population level compliance. If the population is not willing to do so without a mandate, then a mandate should be used - the same as we have used it for years for other illnesses that can result in harm if they spread.

The right/populist faction tends to support traditions whether they understand them or not (distribution is oddly random), though they're united by the Chesterton's Fence tradition that you should understand something before you try to remove or replace it. We certainly do have specific experiences we can use to guide us, of place without law enforcement or with ineffective law enforcement (from Somalia to Seattle's Summer of Love and the streets of San Francisco and many more). From these experiences we have very little to recommend these policies. There is certainly *much* to be reformed in policing as with many systems (every human system is subject to corruption), and the first part of any attempt I would recommend is transparency - the more we know about these systems and their failing, the better we can design our reforms (and abusers in the system and failed reformers outside it have little incentive to make sure this information is available).",2,zealots

It is honestly better to allow them to be legalized within reason as the odds are that mothers would find a way to do it for themselves or have crack pot doctors do it for them. Additionally, there are so many children who are already alive that are in or need to be in foster care that it would be unreasonable to spend our time fighting to keep babies alive so that they can end up even further overextending the system.

Then I became a parent, and slowly, over a period of years, my attitude changed. I marveled, as every parent does, over my baby's development. She started out as a lump that ate and cried and slept and pooped. Over time she rolled over, sat up, cut teeth, learned to understand what was being said to her--she turned into a little person with a personality all her own. It unfolded like a miraculous computer program, all by itself, or rather she did it all by herself. I shoveled it in one end and shoveled it away from the other, but it was all her doing the miracle. I would look at my little girl's head and think about all the potential locked up inside there, waiting to come out. Just think--everything she'll ever be is already in there! And if it's in there now, it was already in there the day she was born, and the day before that, and the day before that...and there is no point at which you can arbitrarily draw a line and say it's ok to kill this person  on this day of gestation but not on the next day. It's your DNA that makes you human and she had that from the moment of conception.
And I'm also a Christian and it's a biblical principal that we are to treat others in the way that is most beneficial to them, not according to our own agenda.

But it is now 2022, and the world is a completely different place than it was 60-70 years ago.

Alcohol is legal and arguably worse than marijuana, if I didn't use it for cooking I would never buy it myself. It's either ban alcohol or make the lesser drugs legal in my opinion",2,zealots

They wouldn't be around to intervene in disputes, which they often do, and deescalate the situation, preventing violence and death. There'd be no police to call when a person's child is kidnapped.

660,"When it comes to abortion, nobody knows exactly when an embryo can be considered a human life. For that reason, it is better to err on the side of caution. People have different definitions of life, but for me, I believe that a beating heart and a functioning brain is a good start. However, some people are not opposed to abortion up until the moment of birth. At that point, shortly before birth, it is most definitely a human life. Abortion in the late-term, while the child can survive outside of the womb, is the same thing as killing a child after it is born.

When abortion occurs, the child (or fetus) is torn apart limb by limb and removed. It is at a time when it's been proven that the fetus is able to feel pain. The process must be excruciating. After the abortion, the doctors reassemble the different limbs to make sure they have all been accounted for. It sounds a lot like ripping apart a human being.

If a child is not wanted, it can be given up for adoption. I've read reports that there are 10 potential parents trying to adopt for every abortion. The aborted child has a chance to live a good life if they are adopted, they don't have that choice if they are aborted.

People argue for abortion rights claiming it is the right of the mother to do what she wants with her own body. But abortion is not just her body, it's also the right of the body of the fetus. If the mother were so concerned about doing what she wanted with her own body, she could have chosen not to get pregnant. Just because a woman gets pregnant shouldn't be a right to end a life.",2,zealots
661,"I think that affirmative action is overtly saying to black communities, ""We don't think you are good enough, smart enough or qualified enough on your own""  I think that there are many great candidates from every ethnicity and race, but affirmative action takes away jobs from well qualified people at times and gives them to lesser suited people based on race alone or having to fill aquota.",2,zealots
663,"With Affirmative action, I am against it. While I understand that schools and companies may use this method, it doesn't seem fair. When it comes to hiring people or accepting people into a school, it is unfair to use certain things to measure them outside of what they are there to do. Like accepting people into a school should only be about their test scores and nothing else. Just like hiring for a job should be about who can do the best job for this companies. While affirmative action may help some people, it will harm others. Sadly in this world, there are no even playing grounds when it comes to this. Some people work harder and get certain things and there are others who work hard and don't get things. It is an unjust practice but affirmative action is just as unjust.",2,zealots
666,"I am in favor of making all abortions illegal.  I think that life begins at conception and as a mother of four I realize what a gift it is to be pregnant.  I think that no one should be able to kill another life even if that life is very small and new, it does not make it less worthy.  I also know of many women who have regretted deeply getting an abortion and if it is illegal, women can not make a big mistake like they did.  I think that there are many wonderful pregnancy crisis centers and there is plenty of help out there, women just have to seek it out.  Abortion is never the answer.  If a women truly does not want their child, it is more morally acceptable to adopt the baby to someone else.",2,zealots
667,"I hold that abortion should always be illegal because it is a black and white issue on all fronts.  There can be no gray area in killing an innocent baby before it is given a chance to breathe.  There are gray areas in Murder or Killing a Human, such as War or Capital Punishment, but these are not innocent acts.  I am all for Pro-Choice - I say give the baby a choice whether it wants to live or not.  The mother is allowed to spread her legs, get pregnant, and then just kill off her mistake without even informing the father!  This is ludicrous and is somehow promoted as shameless and moral in our corrupt society.  Without even bringing God into the equation, a 5 year old child knows right and wrong and knows it is wrong to kill an unborn child.  My autistic son knows this and he doesn't read the bible, go to church, or even pray!",2,zealots

I feel this way because I see my nephew going through school and learning completely different types of things like math, I cannot understand what he has been taught. When I took the SAT, it meant something about my comprehension of the information, now it is not so relevant to students as it was years ago.",2,zealots

690,I slightly oppose legalizing abortion because I am a Christian and I believe that it is murder to kill an unborn baby in the womb. With that being said it is still a very complicated issue for me. I think God put humans on this earth to multiply and to create other humans and when a woman gets pregnant it is her duty to carry the pregnancy to full term and to have the baby. If people are not willing to do this they should not have sex and they should also plan very carefully who they have sex with to make sure the child will grow up in a nurturing environment. I am aware that there are complications in the pregnancy that make it to where either the woman or the child will live and it will either be one or the other so I feel that if an abortion needed to be performed in a life or death situation or if the baby was going to be born with a debilitating condition then I would support this. Also if a woman is the victim of rape or incest she should have the right to choose to get an abortion but this should be extremely limited. Overall I believe 95% of the time the baby should be carried to full term. I believe the Bible is the word of God and there are specific verses in the Bible about God breathing life into us when we are in our mother‚Äôs womb which I would interpret to mean we have life and a soul at that point. That is just what I believe.,2,zealots
695,"Abortion is murder, nothing more.  No person has a right to take another person's life, except in defense of their life or others.  Killing a baby doesn't allow that soul to live and experience this world.  Neither the mother nor the father creates life.  Only God creates life, and only God has the right to decide how or when a life should be taken.  God has full dominion over every living thing, because he created it.  God gave us dominion over animals, and we have the right to take an animal's life, but never a person's life because that it not within our dominion.  If a doctor takes a life, as in the case of abortion, that doctor is guilty of murder, period.  The mother is guilty of murder as well.  God's punishment for murder is death.  Both should have a trial, with two witnesses (including evidence), and they should then be taken out of the courtroom and executed publically in the town square.  They cannot have salvation --in the flesh--, and must be returned to God, so they can face the soul whose body they murdered and ask for their forgiveness as well.  Then there would be no need for abortion laws, and these things would cease to happen among us.  The Law is already written.",2,zealots
699,"Illicit drugs should never become legal under any circumstances.  If you allow small amounts of any drug to be a misdemeanor or legal, you will need large amounts of drugs to supply the users with the drugs they need.

If there are less police willing to work or get fired because they got defunded, criminals would commit more crimes. People would be scared to leave their homes because there are less police to protect them. There would be less resources allocated for police to respond to low level crimes or altercations. People would also be less inclined to follow traffic laws due to potentially not enough police to enforce traffic laws. Thus, it would be detrimental to society to defund the police.",2,zealots

Without a police force, those who have worked for what they have and care for their families would be at never-ending risk of theft and harm and the need to protect themselves, their property and their homes would seem like a full-time job with no holds barred on doing what was necessary to do so. Violence from criminals would be routine, with law-abiding citizens resorting to the same in order to defend themselves.
